1) Introduction<br>

The reliability of a software is its ability to perform a required function 
under given conditions for a given time interval, but it∆s also the probability that it will operate without failure under given conditions for a given time interval.<br>

To evaluate the reliability of a software, we have to do some measurements, and solve a predictio problem : how is the software likely to behave from now, given the past record of failures. <br>

A few metrics must be defined to analyse software reliability. The 
reliability is, as we said above, the probability that the software will execute without 
failure in a given environmment for a given period of time. The mean time to failure or 
MTTF is the time which is expected to elapse between the current time and the next 
failure. The median is the point of statistical distribution that a given quantity is equally 
likely to fall either side of. The ROCOF is the current rate at which failures are occuring.
To analyse the trend of the failures, we use the LAPLACE test.<br>

The uncertainty comes  from two factors, the operational environment 
and the effect of fault removals. Models in software reliability are trying to model these 
two types of uncertainty.<br><br><br>



2) Tools<br>

Dramatic disagreements between these models on the same source can be 
observed sometimes. On one hand there is no universally accurate model, on the other 
hand some of them are sometimes allright. We have no way to select a model a priori, 
so that we need tools to measure the accuracy of the models on a given dataset.
If we have the data t1, ..., ti-1, we want to predict the not yet observed Ti. 
The true distribution of Ti is Fi(t), but the distribution we compute in the model is  . 
Knowing  (ti) we want to know if the model was accurate on the last data subset 
considered. (All this is in terms of a one-step-ahead prediction.)<br> <br>

2.1 Medians<br>

We can draw the medians, which are the points of statistical distribution 
that a given quantity is equally likely to fall either side of. That means that in these 
points, we have R(t)=1/2.<br><br>

 2.2 Prequential likelihood function<br>

For the series of predictions of Tj+1, ..., Tj+n, the prequential likelihood is :
  
We can now compare two models, by calculating the prequential 
likelihood ratio between model 1 and 2 :<br>
  
If this ratio increases as n increases, we can say that model A discredits 
model B. This plot tells us which model is locally performing best.<br><br>

  2.3 U-Plot<br>

If the predictions Fi were true, then   would be realisations of 
independent identically distributed random variables on [0,1]. Thus their closeness to 
this is a measure of the accuracy of the prediction. In order to decide we draw a plot 
called u-plot, using the data subset and the distribution computed by the model. The 
closeness to the line of unit slope is measured through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
distance. If the plot is above the line then the prediction is too optimistic, if it is below 
the line, it is too pessimistic. Because this plot aggregates the datas we can only observe 
global trends on the dataset.<br>
<br>
2.4 Model recalibration<br>

Sometimes predictions seem to be merely biased, as we can evaluate it 
through the u-plot. We can use this past information to recalibrate the model. In order 
to compute the new model we use a spline-smooth version for the u-plot of the raw 
model.<br>
<br>
2.5 Laplace test<br>

This test analyses the trend of the failures. One can extract two types of information from
such a graph : local and global changes. <br>
  When the values are positive (resp. negative), the fiability is globally increasing
(resp. decreasing). On the other side, when the values are increasing (resp. decreasing), 
we have local variations of the fiability.

Part 2 : SOFTRELY - WEB v1.0<br><br>

1) How to run the program<br>
	<PRE>
- Run Netscape
- Open location : http://www-inf.enst.fr/~popentiu/SOFTRELY-
WEB_v1.0/<br>
</PRE>


2) Where to put the data set<br>

- the dataset files must be put in the directory ~popentiu/SOFTRELY-
WEB_v1.0/donnees/
- the model files obtained with J.-P. Blain∆s program R-Vision must be put 
in the directory ~popentiu/SOFTRELY-WEB_v1.0/modeles/
- then the program MakeList must be executed (by typing MakeList in the 
shell). It is located in the directory  ~popentiu/SOFTRELY-WEB_v1.0/ . It must be 
executed in its directory.<br><br>



3) How to use the program<br>
 


You can load a dataset by clicking on the button "load a data set". This 
one will open a new window, containing the list of the disponible datafiles.To choose a 
dataset, click on it in the list and select OK.<br>

 


Once a dataset is loaded it is presented in the two graphics of the first 
window. The graphic "Data set" presents inter-failure times, and the second graphic 
presents the cumulatives failures (in both graphics, versus total elapsed time).<br>

 


Now you can select the tool you want to use : either you will look the 
u_plot, or the median, or the Prequential Likelihood (presented above).
Just click on one of the three buttons of graphic selection. Each one raises 
a window containing a graphic and a list of models available.<br><br>


3.1 The u-plot and the median windows<br>

 

The u-plot window will include the graph itself and the value of the Kol\-
mogorov-Smirnov distance for selected models in either raw and recalibrated forms. 
You can toggle views between raw and recalibrated parametrics by using the button on 
the right side of the graph.
You may choose the models you want to see, by clicking on the related 
buttons, and you also may choose to see the recalibrated models. The graphs will be 
traced with the colors corresponding to the buttons.<br><br>
 
3.2 The prequential likelihood window<br>

 


On the left of the window, you have two lists of the models. The first one 
concerns the models you want to see, and the second one the model you want to be 
the reference, in order to compare each model with a reference model. By default the 
reference model is Littlewood-NHPP. You may change this by clicking on the name of a 
model in the right list. Like in the u-plot window you may switch between raw and 
recalibrated parametrics.<br><br>



Softrely-WEBv1.0 lets you find out if a model is accurate for a particular 
dataset. It may easily be completed with other models, by writing the programs to 
compute medians, likelihood functions and uplot in both raw and recalibrated forms 
and simply adding the model to the list of models considered by the interface. The 
interface is simple to use and may give you alot of informations on a particular dataset.
Our program allows everyone using Netscape or an equivalent software 
(supporting Java), to see the informations in a graphical form.<br><br>

  We will keep this notation until the end.<br>
