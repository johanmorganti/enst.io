<p> This module
enables the configuration of satellite constellations, stations and mobile users
zones.  It simulates satellite ephemeris, generate visibility data between the
satellites of the constellation and users or stations.  Time statistics about
visibility are computed and displayed in the form of reports, curves, images and
maps.
</p>

 
<left><p><b><h3> CAT Configurator </h3></b></p></left>

<p> The CAT Configurator proposes an interface to set
up constellation of satellites, ground stations and mobile user zones.  
</p>

<p> The configuration of a <i>constellation</i> means to give the six orbital elements of each
satellite at a reference date.  This can be done satellite by satellite, or the
constellation generator can be used.  It provides entries for inclined
constellations of the Walker type, or optimized polar Beste
constellations with a reduced set of parameters.  The orbital
elements of each satellite are generated automatically.  Any type of orbit type
can be generated:  LEO, MEO, HEO and of course GEO.
</p>

<p> The <i>ground stations</i> configuration consists in defining its name, location (longitude and latitude),
and minimum elevation angle under which radio links are no more possible.
</p>

<p> The <i>mobile user zone</i> configuration consists in giving for each user its location and
minimum elevation angle.  A user mesh generator is provided to define large
zones with a great number of users.
</p>

<p> The CAT Simulator provides an interface to initialize simulation parameters and to run
the simulation programs, that are totally independent of the interface.  The
main simulations that are provided are the following:
</p>

<ul>

<p> 
<li> <b> Orbital simulations</b></li>
</p>

<p>
After the selection of a constellation file, it
computes the satellites position in time, i.e.  the ephemeris.
</p>

<p> 
<li> <b> Visibility simulations</b></li>
</p>

<p>
The visibility simulations are made after
the selection of a constellation ephemeris file, a ground station file and a
user zone file.  Visibility data of the satellites by the ground stations and by
the users can be computed.  The mutual visibility, which means the simultaneous
visibility of a satellite by a user and a station, can also be computed.
</p>


<p> 
<li> <b> Elevation angles simulations</b></li>
</p>

<p> 
The elevation angles with
which a satellite is seen by a station or the users of the service zone are computed at each time simulation step.  They are then used by the CAT Analyzer or
the <a href="FAT.html"> FAT  </a> for fade margins computations.
</p>

</ul>

<left><p><b><h3> CAT Analyzer </h3></b></p></left>

<p> 
The CAT Analyzer provides powerful tools to process the simulation data of CAT and to
display them in friendly formats.
</p>

<ul>

<p> 
<li> <b> Visibility simulation data analysis </b></li>
</p>


<p>
The first step in analyzing visibility simulation data is the generation
of a time statistical report.  For each station or mobile user, 15 statistical
parameters are computed and stored into a data file.  Typical statistical
parameters of interest are the <i>mean time ratio of visibility of at least 1
satellite</i>, the <i>mean time ratio of visibility of n satellites
simultaneously</i>, the <i>minimum, mean, maximum time of
no-visibility</i>,...<p> This statistical report can then be edited in text
format for a given user or ground station.  A selected statistical parameter can
be displayed for each mobile user of t he service zone on a map with color
levels , or as curve of the evolution of the parameters value as a
function of latitude or longitude.  <p> Time visibility curves can also be
obtained, showing the evolution of the number of satellites in visibility as a
function of time for a given user or ground station.
</p>

<p> 
<li> <b> Elevation simulation data analysis </b></li>
</p>


<p> 
The elevation simulation provides the
elevation angle with which each satellite of the constellation is seen by each
user or station as a function of time.  The analysis enables the computation of
an elevation time statistics report.  This report can be edited as text for a
given user or station.  For a mobile user zone, a selected elevation statistical
parameter can be displayed as a colored map or longitude/latitude curve.  
</p>

<p>
Elevation distributions can also be computed for ground stations as curves or
images (double visibility case).  The evolution of the elevation of the best
elevation satellite as a function of time can also be displayed on a curve for
a given station or user.
</p>

<p> The elevation distribution data can then be used as
input parameters for the Fade Analysis Tools, <a href="FAT.html"> FAT  </a>, in order to compute fade
margins and availability.
</p>

</ul>

<p> 
Some additional visual analysis of data is provided by LEONART :
</p>

<ul>

<p> 
<li> Satellites ground tracks display on a map.</li>
<li> Satellites footprints on a map.</li>
<li>  Ground stations visibility circles on a map.</li>
</p>

</ul>
