<H1>Introduction</H1>
<hr>

<H2>A School at the Crossroads of Contemporary Issues</H2>

Thanks to the work of Shannon, the ideas of information, coding
and messages are gradually supplanting the more traditional
concepts of force and energy in the interpretation of complex
systems. These ideas have come into use in a wide range of areas,
including communications, linguistics, biology, economics, etc,
and are shaping new currents in scientific thought.
Along with the telephone and television, the concept of information
networks is playing a central structuring role for businesses and,
beyond them, for society as well.

<p>
Ours is indeed an "information society". 
We are subject to an ever-increasing flow of information and data,
whose production, transmission, and consumption provide
a challenge for engineers. This trend is accelerating under
the impulse of technological progress in the areas of electronics,
optics, and space, that are increasing channel capacities and
improving storage media.

<p>
But the tremendous amount of unfiltered
data can lead to noise and confusion. To give users effective
access to relevant information, that is to produce knowledge from
data, is no longer simply a matter of transmission, but requires
the selection and processing that lead to understanding.
Networks must inevitably become "intelligent".

<H2>The Dynamics of Instruction and Research</H2>

Because of the constant development of its research potential,
ENST ranks among the best institutions in Europe
and world-wide. In qualitative terms, the research potential
of the school is represented by more than 300 full-time
researchers and almost 150 doctorate students in 1992.
The continual interaction between instruction and research
in the laboratories of the school ensures excellence in
teaching and a sound knowledge of fields that are in constant
evolution.

<H2>Partners with Business</H2>

Businesses are the school's partners for research and innovation:
mutually-led research projects, the licensing of research results,
knowledge transfer, contracts, etc. The research contracts with
industry represented 12.4 MF in gross receipts for 1991.
With the Louis Leprince-Ringuet Foundation and a number of work
and study groups in which they participate, businesses have
an active part to play in the development of the school:
education, research, international influence.

<H2>An International Academic Synergy</H2>

The school is part of a larger institution for graduate-level
instruction in telecommunications that links the Ecole
Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications in Brittany
(TELECOM Bretagne), the Institut National des Télécommunications
in Evry (INT), and their affiliates in Lille, Sophia Antipolis,
and Poznan (Poland).

<p>
ENST has close relations with the other "Grandes Ecoles"
(France's top higher education institutes), particularly in the
Group of Engineering Institutes of Paris, among them some
of the most prestigious school in France.

<p>
The school has also developed exchanges with French and foreign
universities for common research projects, bilateral exchanges
of students and professors (a joint diploma with Stuttgart), etc.
