<H1>An International Perspective</H1>
<hr>

<H2>Learning Languages: a Priority</H2>
One of the School's aims is to enable students to express themselves
with ease and confidence in at least two foreign languages, one of
them necessarily English. Whether it is to begin with a language
or to perfect one's knowledge of a language already studied,
a student can find a wide choice in the Language Department
including English, German, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, Russian,
Hebrew, Polish and Japanese.

<p>
Students can work on their oral expression in small groups. Magazines,
newspapers, and audio and video tapes are available for students,
who can also practice their skills in an English-language theater
group and language tables in the School cafeteria.

<H2>International Connections</H2>
ENST is among one of the most internationally-oriented
engineering schools: 22% of its students come from abroad.
French students must spend at least two months overseas and
three-quarters of the School's students carry out an internship
in a non French-speaking country. There is also a strong
involvement in the European Community's programs and a wide range
of partnerships with more than fifty foreign universities.

<H2>Third Year Overseas</H2>
At the end of their program of study, students may spend an entire
year overseas and receive their diploma from ENST and,
in some cases, a degree from the university where they have spent
the year. Opportunities include a joint diploma with the University
of Stuttgart and Masters of Science in the United States.
