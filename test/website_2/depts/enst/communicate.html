<H2>Communication, Sociology and Humanities</H2>

Joining a company means becoming part of a team, helping
it meet its goals, and assuming the social--not to say--the
sociable aspect of team work. ENST has designed a course
of instruction that gives students the opportunity to develop
skills as effective confident communicators. This is a key
component of their future personal and professional lives.

<p>
This preparation includes diagnostic exercises for oral and written
communications. Internships are analyzed in terms of the
organizational framework and the student's personal experience.
A number of seminars are dedicated to the basic techniques of
expression and communication as well as to the organizational
contexts and the possibilities of individual initiative.

<p>
For those who wish to broaden their training by an analysis
of contemporary political, social and cultural contexts, there
are courses in history and geopolitics that are offered, as well
as philosophy, psychoanalysis or the history of art.
The Department of Humanities has focused its research activities
on communication between individuals. In particular, it studies
the ways of teaching communication and management, the models
of personal communication, the situations and strategies of
communication and the relations between writing and computing.
