<left><b> <h2> LEONART-FAT : Fade Analysis tools </h2></b></left>



<p> 
The FAT module proposes the simulation
of a basic set of satellite-mobile radio channel fading models.  In correlation
with elevation data computed by the <a href="CAT.html"> CAT  </a> module for a given constellation, the
necessary fade margins can be computed for a given link availability, or, the
resulting link availability computed for a given fade margin.
</p>

<p> The FAT module proposes the simulation of a basic set of
satellite-mobile radio channel fading models.  Fade models that are provided are
empirical and distribution models.  
</p>

<p> Empirical models are models based on
measurements and provide a derived equation to compute the fade exceeded for a
given link availability as a function of satellite elevation.  Two models are
implemented in LEONART which are the NASA ERS (Empirical Roadside Shadowing)
model, and the Coverage model or Large Scale-Small Scale (LS-SS) model which are
described in the NASA Reference Publication 1274.  Fade or availability curves can be displayed as a
function of elevation.  
</p>

<p> 
The distribution models provided are the Rice and
Rayleigh and the Lutz fade models, which combines Rice and Rayleigh
distributions in a number of environments.  The Rice distribution provides a
model of the unshadowed link between a satellite and a mobile, and the Rayleigh
distribution a model of the shadowed link.  The Lutz model takes into account
the two possible states of the link (shadowed or not) to model the fade
distribution in various environments from fade measurements.  The FAT module
enables the constitution of a Lutz model database.  The density and distribution
curves of each model can be displayed.

<p> 
availability computations<p> The CAT module provides the distribution of the
elevation of the best elevation satellite in visibility.  The fade models
provide the fade margin or either the link availability as a function of the
elevation.  From this two set of data, for a given constellation and users zone,
and for a given fade model, the expected value of the fade margin or the link
availability can be computed for each user.  Fade margins and link
availability reports can be edited and analyzed, for various link availability
and fade margins respectively.
