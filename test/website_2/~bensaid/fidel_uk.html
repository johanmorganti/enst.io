<B>FIDEL </B>( FRANCE ISRAEL DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC LINKS ) is an association (under July 1st, 1901 law) which is composed by students of the French higher education who are trained by professionals with the intention of developing the economic and commercial links between France and Israel. <P>

Commercial technical and juridicial <A HREF="fidetud1.html">studies</A> are carried out by the association on behalf of Israeli companies who wish to strengthen their links with France and conversely.<P>
The association undertakes also to act as the mediator between students who want to go on a 
<A HREF="fidstag.html">course </A>in the other country and companies that are able to receive them.<P>Jeudi 6 Fevrier
<B>FIDEL</B> organizes <A HREF="fidconf2.html">conferences</A> and discussions about French Israeli economic relations, or any other activity which correspond to the purpose of the association.<P>
For all that, <B>FIDEL</B> uses a single information and communication network : in addition to connections in many higher education schools there are very complete database concerning French and Isreali companies, organisms and personalities who could be interested in our activities. 
<BR>Moreover, <B>FIDEL</b> uses Internet : in addition to our web which is very consulted now, our connections with French as well as Israeli people are very frequent. Finally, the association is supported by the Israeli Embassy in France, and by the French Chamber of Commerce in Israel ...
<P>
<b>FIDEL</b> answers to a real demand in this field. Indeed, the vague impulsions are not lacking in a sense of reinforcing the economic relations between both countries. But French or Israeli companies had not privileged contact, to whom they could speak for first approaches until now, because the institutions or professionals who work on it are totally snowed under with. For that,<B> FIDEL </b>exists now ...
<P>
