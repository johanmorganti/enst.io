<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Objectives</H1>

<H3>"Cooperation/Competition"</H3>

<P>Taking advantage of the common research they had been carrying out
since signing a cooperative agreement in 1984, French and American
researchers from the Conf&eacute;ference des Grandes Ecoles, the
University of California at Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology organized a first Symposium in Paris, May 1991. European and 
American academics, industrialists and government officials reviewed the 
state of advanced technological fields. They focused on the new economic 
and industrial challenges faced by our society and underlined the new 
dialectics of international relations, coupling cooperation and 
competition.</P>

<H3>"Competitive partnership"</H3>

<P>These considerations led them to review the traditional training of 
the scientists and engineers who will increasingly have to work on 
several fronts: scientific, technological and industrial but also social 
and human. How should we go about developing a more comprehensive view of 
these multiple aspects? This question was the theme of Symposium II, "The 
culture of engineering in a rapidly changing world", which took place in 
Berkeley in November 1993. The need was underlined for a new culture of 
engineering: it should not only be based on solid scientific knowledge 
and the ability to master new technologies, but also integrate human and 
social sciences and enable a new form of relationship, the "competitive 
partnership".</P>

<H3>"A new technological system for a global society"</H3>

<P>Technology appears to be the basis for the global society of the 
future, leading to drastic changes in worldwide exchanges and creating 
new adaptive challenges. Conversely international competition and 
interdependencies strongly impact research, development and 
implementation of new technologies and their viability. This is the theme 
proposed for the third Symposium, "A new technological system for a 
global society", which will take place in Sophia-Antipolis in the south 
of France on May 27-30, 1996.</P>

<P>Symposium III will gather scientists, industrialists, economists, 
academics and decision-makers from Europe, North America and, for the 
first time, Asia. Together they will attempt to get a clearer view of the 
current evolution, examining in particular the new global technological 
system which is emerging. They will also review strategies that 
individuals, corporations and governments could adopt to balance 
socio-economic development, employment and the protection of the 
environment.</P>
