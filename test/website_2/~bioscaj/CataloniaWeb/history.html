<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Catalunya (Catalonia in catalan language) is a small country, with
32.000km<SUP>2</SUP> and six million inhabitants, located on the
north-east corner of the Iberian peninsula, bordering with France on
the northern side, with the Mediterranean Sea on the south-east and
with the regions of Arag&oacute;n and Val&egrave;ncia on the west and
south.</P>

<P>With its 1.6 millions inhabitants (about 3 in the city area),
Barcelona is Catalunya's capital and can be described as a
historical, cultural, modern and Mediterranean city, but above all as
a lively city, prosperous and dynamic and its best asset is, without
any doubt, its people.</P>

<P>Catalunya is a region with a long tradition and history. Lets take
a look at it.</P>

<H3>The first Inhabitants (1000 BC)</H3>

<P>The oldest known inhabitant of Catalunya would now be 500.000
years old. We are not sure how he used to look like, but we know he
had a strong mandible as we found a picture of it on a piece of stone
in Banyoles. Life by that time was not easy, but they manage to
survive as at 1000 BC they were still there to see how some visitors
were coming from the north: the Celtic tribes. The Celts People in
Catalunya had much fun. Those people coming from the other side of
Europe knew quite a lot of things. They were also nice, so they both
learned one from each other. Sometime later, one of those guys was
laying on the beach when suddenly he saw some boats approaching the
cost. People on those boats were quite hungry and thirsty, and, as
they seamed quite friendly, they were invited to have a good catalan
meal.</P>

<H3>The Greeks and Phoenicians (550 BC)</H3>

<P>While having that meal, those strange people talking strange
words, tried to explain that they were coming from far away, a place
called Greece. They had with them some nice ceramics so they made a
good deal: they exchanged that for gold and metals. Some of them
decided to stay the others took their boats and followed their
journey. Those staying teach to catalans lots of things: how to build
strong houses, streets and walls even if they were not really needed
by that time. They also gave them an alphabet to use: each sound was
represented by a letter. It was great! Eivissa, Roses,
Emp&uacute;ries are cities created by them. The latest,
Emp&uacute;ries, was created sometime around the year 550 BC. It was
called by Greek people: Emporion. It rapidly became the most
important city, with its big market place, the port and a big temple.
Don't forget to visit it if you ever come to Catalunya!
Unfortunately, not everybody coming to Catalunya where as nice as the
Celts, Greeks or Phoenicians. Some people coming from the north of
Africa, the Carthaginians, came to visit them with not very good
intentions (300 BC). Also the Romans came to fight them and they won
(15 BC).</P>

<H3>The Romans (218 BC)</H3>

<P>People near the cost had not much problems with those people
coming from Rome. They were used to have visitors and Romans didn't
want to fight if it wasn't really necessary. Romans stayed in
Catalunya for a very long, long time. That's why catalans learned so
much from them. They even tried to teach them their language: the
Latin. Sincerely, it was not easy but they did their best. The result
was a new language: the catalan. Val&egrave;ncia, Barcelona,
Zaragoza, all these cities were created by the Romans and connected
with big roads made of stones. Nowadays, these roads still exist and
they still follow the same way, even if they have been turned into
motor ways.</P>

<H3>The New Born Catalunya: The Visigoths (415 AC)</H3>

<P>Since 218 BC romans had been in Catalunya. Seven centuries later,
they weren't as strong as the first day they arrived. That's why,
some people called the Visigoths, came from the north and installed
themselves in Spain. They tried to continue with what the romans had
created but they also imposed their laws and things were not as nice
as some hundred years before. Anyway: it was not so bad. Three
hundred years after, sometime around 711, a group of people came from
the south: the Moors.</P>

<H3>The Moors (713 AC)</H3>

<P>These people came from North Africa and invaded the whole of
Spain. They were quite aggressive and not very friendly. They crossed
Catalunya as they were going to invade also France. But somebody up
there stop them. The Christians in Catalunya saw their salvation when
the king of France, Charles Magne, pushed the long black dressed
people down to the south. Cities such as Girona and Barcelona became
free. The French King gave those pieces of land to some Sirs to
protect it from other invasions. When the pirates arrived to the
south of France, the King asked to his servants in Catalunya to help
him. The Count of Barcelona, Guifr&eacute; el Pil&oacute;s (Wilfred
the hairy), went to battle with the French people where he died. The
King of France put four of his fingers into the wound of
Guifr&eacute; and draw with the blood of the dying man, four lines
onto the golden shield of Guifr&eacute;. It was the first time we
could see the Catalan Flag, la Senyera. Sometime after, the Arabians
came back and the counts asked their Sir (the French king) to protect
them, which was his obligation. He did not send any troops, so the
counts decided that they were not in duty with him anymore: Catalunya
was born.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Proven&ccedil;a</H3>

<P>The Count of Barcelona had made his domain bigger and bigger. Not
only inside Catalunya but also outside: the marriage between
Berenguer III and the countess of Proven&ccedil;a made the Catalan
border go beyond the Pyrenees.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Arag&oacute; (1137 AC)</H3>

<P>The King of Arag&oacute;, somewhere to the west of Catalunya, had
a big problem: he had only one daughter and was afraid of the King of
Castella who wanted to conquest the whole peninsula. To solve both
problems, he married his daughter with the Count of Barcelona, Ramon
Berenguer IV, and the Regne de Catalunya and Arag&oacute; was
created.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Mallorca</H3>

<P>On 1229, the young King Jaume I left Catalunya with 150 chips,
15000 soldiers and 2000 horses. He first conquest Mallorca. The
catalan spoken there nowadays, is still the one that used to be talk
by that time and it is called mallorqu&iacute;.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Val&egrave;ncia</H3>

<P>When the Arabians, that were still in Spain, were expelled of
Val&egrave;ncia, people from Catalunya and Arag&oacute; moved to live
there. The mixture of their languages was a new one. The resulting
language is what we call today the valenci&agrave;.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Sic&iacute;lia</H3>

<P>Pere III of Arag&oacute; and II of Catalunya was married with
Constan&ccedil;a of Sic&iacute;lia. He was the inheritor of that Land
but by that time it was controlled by French people. The inhabitants
of Sicilia were not very happy of that and asked for help to the
catalans. The French were won on 1282. Seven years later, appeared
the "Generalitat" as a sort of committee representing the three
traditional states - commons, nobilty and cleracy - but became
gradually responsible for administering public order and justice as
well as the defence of a kingdom that, by the middle of the 14 th
century, had expanded to the Balearic Islands, Val&egrave;ncia, South
of France, Sicily, Athens, Corica, Malta, Sardinia and Naples.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and the Mediterrani</H3>

<P>The year 1311 the catalans went to visit theirs friends the Greeks
and create the ducts of Athens and Neop&agrave;tria. Later they
arrived to Constantinople Alexandria. It was a great time. The
catalan sailors had no fear. If there was bad weather, they could
stop in Sic&iacute;lia, Sardenya, C&ograve;rsega, Athena, Alexandria,
Mallorca or in any port of Catalunya or Val&egrave;ncia. Everywhere
they could feel home.</P>

<H3>Catalunya and Castella (1412 AC)</H3>

<P>The last Compte of Barcelona died without having a son. Three
persons from Arag&oacute;, three from Catalunya and three from
Val&egrave;ncia met in Casp to decide who would be the next king.
Even if the people from Catalunya didn't agree, Ferran I coming from
Castella was elected. Ferran was not used to the habits of catalan
people so it was not very popular. During that time, there where
quite a lot of problems between the rich and the poor people in
Catalunya, but the King was not there to solve those problems: he had
gone to Napoli where he was living 'like a King'. His brother was
Joan II who took the power for him. His son, Ferran II married Isabel
de Castella putting Catalunya and Castella altogether. By that time
Colon came back from his first expedition to America, to the port of
Barcelona: he was bringing with him lots of beautiful things. During
the 16 th century, being deprived of trading opportunities with the
Americas, Catalunya grew impoverished and consequently declared its
independence in 1635. 17 years later, in 1652, the country had to
surrender to the Spanish army. "<A HREF="segadors.html">Els
Segadors</A>", the reapers, the marching song of this war, became the
Catalan anthem. By the beginning of the 18 th century, Bourbon king
Felipe V initiated another repression period for Catalunya: the
Catalan university in Barcelona was closed, the language banned and
the government abolished. Barcelona revolted against Felipe V, and
though it ended up with a defeat on September 11th 1714, this day,
symbol of heroic and courageous resistance, has been chosen as the
Catalan national day, "La Diada", celebrated every year.</P>

<H3>Catalunya under Felipe V the first Borb&oacute;n (1714 AC)</H3>

<P>Felipe V was the first king of the Borb&oacute;n family. He first
made the unification of lows. Until then, catalans had got his own
low, but he suppressed the Diputaci&oacute;, Concell de Cent and the
Virrei. In the new government system, plenty of layers, judges came
from Castella speaking Castellano (Spanish). That's why the catalan
was being used less and less. During the XIX century the catalan
industry develop very quickly: the first train in Spain was build in
Catalunya and not only the steam machines for the big chips were made
in Barcelona, but also the first submarine was invented by
Narc&iacute;s Monturiol.</P>

<H3>Catalunya entering the XX Century</H3>

<P>The beginning of the XX century was great again. The catalan was
being used again even for writing books, magazines, newspapers, or
even poetry. We had great writers like, Jacint Verdaguer, Josep
Carner or even Joan Maragall announcing the spring time:</P>

<P><CENTER>A mig aire de la serra<BR>

veig un ametller florit:<BR>

D&eacute;u te guard, bandera blanca,<BR>

dies ha que t'he delit!</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Ets la pau que s'anuncia<BR>

entre el sol, n&uacute;vols i vents...<BR>

No ets encara el millor temps,<BR>

pro en tens tota l'alegria.</CENTER></P>

<P>Not all artist were writers. Some known names are: Ramon Casas,
Santiago Rusi&ntilde;ol, Anselm Clav&eacute;,
<A HREF="CantDelsOcells.html">Pau Casals</A>, Antoni Gaud&iacute;...
</P>

<H3>Catalunya under the General Franco</H3>

<P>In 1909, political problems arose again, the "setmana
tr&agrave;gica" (the tragic week), took place in Barcelona, with
riots of objecting catalans not willing to enlist to go to fight in
Morocco (more than 100 people died). Political movements, working
class strikes and strong violence caused a military coup in 1923 led
by general Primo de Rivera. This dictatorship meant again the end of
all Catalunya's privileges if self-government.</P>

<P>However , in 1930, after the great economic depression, Primo de
Rivera was forced to resign and, a few months later, the second
republic was founded. Catalunya, led by Francesc Maci&agrave;, won
again its autonomy, with Barcelona as the capital. But the economic
recession, the political instability and the weakness of the Spanish
republican government straightened up both anarchism and falangism
(fascism). Finally, on July 17 th, 1936, general Franco revolted
against the government, his semi-failed "coup d'Etat" leading to a
bitter and bloody civil war (mass slaughtering by the nationalists,
priest and right-wing supporters shooting by the republicans). The
help of fascist Italy and nazi Germany definitely contributed to
Franco's victory, with the fall of BARCELONA, and January, 25 th,
1939 and the execution, one year later, of Llu&iacute;s Companys,
president of Catalunya.</P>

<P>The war over, Spain and Catalunya sank in a dark autarchic period
because of the establishment of Franco's 40 years of dictatorship,
which meant again the Catalan culture persecution (more than 100.000
Catalans were exiled). This dictatorial policy led to the isolation
of Spain from the rest of the world, thus staying behind all
development and economic growth. Only during the 60's and 70's came
some prosperity.</P>

<P>Franco's death in November 20 th 1975 and the previous murdering
in 1973 of general Carrero Blanco (his minister and potential
successor as dictator) by the terrorist group E.T.A., finally meant
the end of the dictatorship and the beginning of democracy.
Democratisation came thanks to Juan Carlos I (king of Spain and head
of state by virtue of Franco's will), who appointed Adolfo Suarez as
the transition prime minister. A degree of autonomy was granted to
Catalunya on the 1977 elections, meaning the reestablishment, after
almost 40 years of absence, of the Catalan government, the
"Generalitat".</P>

<P>The new Spanish constitution was approved in October 1978 and one
year later the Statute of Autonomy for Catalunya. The first Catalan
elections were held in 1980 and won by Jordi Pujol (CiU) who's been
ever since reelected president of the Generalitat of Catalunya.</P>

<H3>Catalunya today</H3>

<P>If you really want to know what Catalunya is today, you better
come and visit us. Don't listen to what people will tell you; come
and see it by yourself!</P>
