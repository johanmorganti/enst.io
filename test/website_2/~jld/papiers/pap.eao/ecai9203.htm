SAVANT3: uttering surprise to make the student explain</H1>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Our system SAVANT3 functions according to the surprise-based explanation
principle. It tries to make an incompatibility explicit, and thus offers the
student the opportunity to explain it, i.e. to invalidate it directly or
indirectly.<p>
<p>
[interaction with SAVANT3]<p>
context: this dialog is proposed as an introduction to a digital communication
course. Some concepts like digital symbols were presented, and then a printed
page is displayed. The student may consider the page as a succession of
characters (teletext-like coding) or as a succession of pixels (Fax-like
coding). In any case, problems may arise.<p>
<i>S1-	Can we consider a printed text as a digital message ?</i><p>
<i>E1-	sure</i><p>
<i>S2-	According to what I understood: this typed page can be considered as a
digital message. We have to consider symbols allowing a complete description of
the page</i><p>
<i>E2-	characters</i><p>
<i>S3-	yes...  mmm...  According to what I understood: the points (pixels) in
the page  are not taken as symbols. What else in the page could we code, if we
except printed characters?</i><p>
<i>E3-	you mean if there are drawings?</i><p>
<i>S4-	But there may be a problem ... If we consider that one wants to code for
figures (schemas, photos, signature)...</i><p>
<i>E4-	but this is a printed page</i><p>
<i>S5-	yes...  According to what I understood: one chooses a TELETEXT-like
coding. Printed characters are not the only thing to be coded... </i><p>
<i>E5-	no</i><p>
<i>S6-	Could you say more?...</i><p>
<i>E6-	margins, paragraphs</i><p>
<i>S7-	yes...  mmm...  But wait... According to what you said: one wants to
code for positions (paragraphs, etc.). I must say I'm confused !</i><p>
<i>E7-	you use special codes</i><p>
<i>S8-	well, well!...  Okay...</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b></b>The functioning of SAVANT3 is quite simple, and reminds of the
entrapment strategy used in WHY ([Collins 1976]). The knowledge given to
SAVANT3 on a specific subject consists of a set of incompatibilities:<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>[ p<sub>11</sub> <b>&amp; </b>p<sub>12 </sub><b>&amp; . . . &amp;
</b>p<sub>1n</sub> ]   ==&gt; <b>F</b><p>
[ p<sub>21</sub> <b>&amp; </b>p<sub>22 </sub><b>&amp; . . . &amp;
</b>p<sub>2m</sub> ]   ==&gt; <b>F</b><p>
<b>. . .</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This knowledge is thus structured as if it contained only consistency
production rules (as those of the COVADIS system described in [Ayel 1990]).
Some of these clauses may become invalid at a given point of the conversation
with the student (when at least one term is false). SAVANT3 looks for a valid
clause (e.g. clause <i>j</i> if all <i>p<sub>ji</sub></i><sub> </sub>are known
to be true or are still unknown), it utters known terms and pretends to be
surprised (as in S7). The student then has the possibility to deny a mentioned
term (direct invalidation, as in E4) or an non-mentioned one (indirect
invalidation, as in E7).<p>
<p>
The functioning of SAVANT3 is illustrated below (cf. [dessalles 1991] for
greater detail). At each point during the interaction, the system makes
utterances or feigns surprise in order to verify the most promising valid
clause (i.e. the clause with highest proportion of known terms). If enough
terms in this clause are known, then the program utters surprise. Otherwise it
utters a "canned" sentence associated with the next unknown term in the clause
(as in S5). This clause may change several times during interaction. Notice
that the possibility for SAVANT3 to recognize indirect invalidations comes from
the fact that some premises are intentionally "forgotten" when surprised is
uttered, as was the case in S7.<p>

SAVANT3 is able to utter surprise and to recognize relevant explanations given
by the student as invalidations, but it is unable to recognize surprise in the
student's utterances. Our program PARADISE (see [dessalles 1990]), designed to
reconstruct conversations, is able to recognize that some utterances are
intended to express a logical incompatibility (as in [ex_canteen]), and is able
to suggest explanations as solutions to these incompatibilities. To achieve
this, PARADISE considers predicates in the interlocutor's utterance<a
name="fnB0" href="#fn0">[*]</a> and looks for a clause in its knowledge that
contains most of these predicates. This clause, if found, expresses an
incompatibility, and may be considered as the intended meaning of the
interlocutor's utterance.<p>
<a name="fn0" href="#fnB0">[*]</a> PARADISE has no syntactic capabilities and
must be given utterances in a succession of <i>subject / verb / complement
</i>inputs.
