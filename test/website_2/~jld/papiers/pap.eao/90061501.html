Summary 
</ul>
<ul>
The present study shows that there is a qualitative difference 
between concept and skill acquisition, and that it may have
some consequences on the design of C.A.I. courseware.
We show for instance that concept learning is essentially a logical
process, based on rule acquisition or modification, and that 
conversation (free dialogue) is best suited for concept transmission.
This paper describes a mixed-initiative dialogue module which is
part of the "SAVANT 3" CAI system.
