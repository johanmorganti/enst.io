#
# This file contains the sounds that will be played during the game.
#
# Each line should contain the name of a sound file, followed by the default
# volume for the sound (0 = no sound, 1 = lowest volume, 100 = normal,
# 200 = very loud and noisy).   Everything else on the line is ignored; use it
# for comments.
#
# The order of these sounds must correspond to the numbers in include/sounds.h
# You don't have to supply the full path names to the files, because they are
# in the rplay configuration file (rplay.conf).
