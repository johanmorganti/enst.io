# List of artifact modifiers
#
# Note: weight, last_sp, last_heal is in percent (200% would
#	be twice normal, 50% half of normal), while 
#       damage and armour is in 10-percents - a value between 0 and 10
#	would have lesser armour (value of 5 would be half as much armour
#	as usual, value of 20  would be twice as much armour as usual)
#       (these values, if negative, are negatively absolute)
#       The rest of the values are all absolute
#
#	'value' is a multiplier to the previous value (value 10
#	means the object is worth 10 times normal)
#
#	the 'material', 'slaying', and 'msg' elements will replace
#	exiting values.
#
#	magic is the mininum magic for an item to become that artifact.
#
# This file has been changed around in 0.91.1 to allow better
# control of probability and creation conditions.
#
# Allowed is followed with a comma seperated list of items that
# that artifact is allowed for.  a ! can precede the object name,
# to mean that the object is allowed for all objects except those with
# that name.  The name will be matched to either the normal item
# name, or the name of the archetype
#
#
# After the 'Allowed <whatever>' field, a 'chance <value>' field
# follows.  This is how likely the item is to be created.  It is relative
# to other objects of the same type.  What happens is that all of the
# artifacts with the same type are put on 1 list, and their chance
# field is summed together.  Then, when an artifact is created,
# a roll is made based on that sum, and the appropriate artifact
# is chosen.  If the item being transformed can not turn into that
# artifact (magic bonus, difficulty (see below), or just now 'Allowed'), 
# it will be re-rolled, attempting to make an artifact again.  The number
# of re-rolls attempted is determined in the treasures file.  IT is,
# by default, 1.
#
# 'difficulty <value>' can also be included before the 'Object <name>'
# field.  If set, the difficulty must be greater or equal to that
# value in order to the object to be created.  This can make it so that
# some items are never created on easy maps.
#
# Because of these changes, general artifact types are no longer allowed.
# This is for a few reasons: 1) With no type, it would not be possible
# to know what lists to put it on.  If it put it on all lists
# presently existing, then the order of this file would become relevant,
# 2) Since chance is now a a field, and different items types have
# different total chances, using a generic chance value could have
# unexpected results.
#
# Various notes:
# chance is meaningless if there is only 1 artifact of a certain
# type.  It will always be generated, no matter what the chance
# is set to.  As such, if adding an artifact for a new type,
# make sure there are at least two, unless you always want
# that specific one to be generated.
#
# running crossfire with -m3 creates a nice list of this
# table.  Good for debugging if you seem to have problems with
# some entry.

  This extremely unique platemail was made
  for the line of dwarven kings in one of the 
  ancient northern kingdoms from which nothing has
  been heard of during the latter centuries.
  Due to magic, it will fit creatures of any size.
  It is highly enchanted, increasing the strength of the 
  wearer and protecting against fire.  
  Unfortunately it is also very heavy, limiting speed somewhat.
