<h2><a name="a61">Students' syllabus in languages</a></h2>
<p>It is important for students to consider their three year <a href="francoise.html">language program</a> as a whole spread over three years. The study of two foreign languages is obligatory.
<p>Given the importance of <a href="lgv5.html#a52">English</a> for an engineer, all students take at least one <a href="lgv5.html#a52">English</a> course during their whole degree program.
<p>One talks about second and third languages to designate language choices other than English. It is important for students to think in terms of an overall languages program especially when they want to study a second or third language.
<p>To refresh or to perfect a second language is always possible but beginning a new language, especially in second year, requires careful thought: the third year training period is often a long interruption. However, it is possible to reach a functional level in a language after one year of study. Experience shows that personal interest and motivation are the main criteria when choosing a second or a third language.
<hr>
<h2><a name="a62>Obligations : credit system</h2>
Students with French as a mother tongue must obtain 6 UV's (credits) a year during the first and the second year (except Eurecom students: 3 UV) which represents about 4 1/2 hours of classes a week.
<p>Foreign students who are not French speakers must obtain 4 UV's during the first and second year. The required credit total (languages and options) remains the same as for French students.
<p>In third year, after their internship, students must obtain 3 language credits.
<p>Auditors have no obligations in terms of credits  or tests.
<p>Generally, students follow more courses than the required minimum. A student of a weak level in two languages can take 6 hours of classes a week.
<p>It is possible to accumulate language credits acquired above the minimum. They will be capitalized up to 4 UVs for CC students and 2 for AST at the end of their study program.
<p>Even if courses are yearly, UVs are attributed every semester after an intermediate evaluation: this facilitates the application of make-up projects.

<p>Three factors are essential for the grade given:
<ul>
<li>graded work
<li>student participation
<li>regular attendance (the UV is not given when the total number of absences exceeds 25%)
<li>A passing grade of 10 out of 20 is necessary to get the UV.
</ul>

<h2><a name="a63">How to plan one's language syllabus</a></h2>
<p>After evaluating your level in the different languages which interest you, it is necessary to plan your <a href="francoise.html">weekly</a> schedule in blocks of 1 1/2, 3 or 4 1/2 hours (the last is very rare). In some exceptional cases, there some blocks of one hour placed during midday pauses.
<p>Weekly 1 1/2 hour classes are for students of intermediate level; for lower levels, students have 3 hour courses modules.
<p>Your courses may be reserved only to students of your graduating class or be mixed. Most often, it is a mix of both. This distinction is relevant for the department bulletin boards where class lists are posted.
<p>Starting from an upper-intermediate level, a student can follow either thematic courses or general courses.
<p>The choices of the student can be accepted only if they are realistic (scheduling between all the courses and the size of certain courses).
<p>The Language Department usually advizes not to take courses for two languages in which you are a beginner. Moreover, a student cannot begin a language in the third year because it is too difficult to acquire a functional level in only 6 months.
<p>The department gives advice to new students about their choices during level evaluation interviews at the beginning of their first year in school. 
<hr>
<h2><a name="a64>Weekly courses by level</a></h2>
<p>Students must take a minimum number of courses (one sequence stands for 1H30 of courses) depending on their level.
