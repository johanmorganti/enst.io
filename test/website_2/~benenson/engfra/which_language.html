<P>
<B><H2>SHOULD I WRITE TO THE FORUM IN MY LANGUAGE OR IN MY PARTNER'S LANGUAGE?</H2></B>

It is up to you!!! If you want our opinion we'll give it to you later on. Now we want to help you decide. How? by showing the pros and cons:

<P>
<B><H3>ADVANTAGES</H3></B>
	
Let's begin with the advantages of using your mother-tongue: it is easier , it will probably make you feel more comfortable and confident, you will not make mistakes and thus provide a good model for your colleagues, etc.

<P>
<B><H3>DISADVANTAGES</H3></B>

	If you use the foreign language, you will have to work much harder and you may produce a poor model for the other participants from your country that take part in the Forum. The problem is that using your own language you will be more passive and ... we want you to be active! You have many opportunities to be passive: you can always sit down at home on your favorite armchair and read the lyrics of your favorite band's last record.

<P>
<B><H3>OUR OPINION</H3></B>

	Which ever language you choose you have to feel at ease and be aware of the difficulties your colleagues may find when trying to decode the last idiom that came to your mind while trying to be natural and colloquial.
	<P>
If you are a beginner, we are afraid all you can do is being passive and wait patiently until you have the necessary tools to write in the foreign language.

<P>
<B><H3>RECOMMENDATION</H3></B>

	Always remember that the two languages must be used, so help to keep the balance!  ************************************
