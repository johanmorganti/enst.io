<B>Estaban</B> - It is because when I make love, my heart leaves my body for heaven. And when it is over and my heart has to come back, it is very sad.

<P>
<B>Lynette</B> - Huh. See, my crying is a little different. When I make love and my heart leaves my body I'm always expecting to meet Bobby's heart outside his body. But Bobby's heart - well Bobby has a hard time opening up, if you met his family you'd understand - his heart doesn't really leave his body. So my heart is out there all alone waiting while Bobby finishes up. Below. And then he falls asleep and I'm still out there, floating and feeling very lonely. And then I cry and wake Bobby up and he gets annoyed. Which is not to say that I don't get a lot of other things from him.
