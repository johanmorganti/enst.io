with my partner? </font></h2>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Communicating via
email is difficult because you can&#146;t see your partner to
judge their reaction. It is therefore particularly important to
take care to maintain a good relationship. It is up to you both
to do this- no-one else can do it for you! Three su ggestions for
this are: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">keep your partner
        informed </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">ask your partner
        for the information you need </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">answer their
        questions </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Suggestions for
discussion with your partner are: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">how often you
        would like to write </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">what you would
        like to write about </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">how you would
        like to be corrected (if at all) </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">how long your
        letters will be </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">holiday times or
        exam times </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Don&#146;t forget to
ask them what you want to know AND to answer their questions! </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If you have any other
ideas for maintaining a good relationship with your partner, let
us know! </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Good luck! Have fun.</font></p>
