<P>Some day you will fly the nest if you haven't done so already. Is it the same for your partner?
<h3>Task</h3>
<P>Well, that is today's task. Ask your partner the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Do you still live at home?
<li>If yes: In what circumstances? (own room, paternal control, money ...) Why do you stay at home? Under what circumstances would you have left home?
<li>If no: Why did you decide to leave? Is it the norm? Where does the money come from? Was it easy to find accommodation?
</ul>
<P>Whatever the answer, both you and your partner are adults. Is it natural to want to be independant and to make one's own way in life?
<ul>
<li>Is it easy to do? What are the difficulties that have to be overcome? What are your own experiences?
</ul>
<P><br>
