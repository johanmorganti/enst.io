<h1>Speaking without words</h1>
<p>In every language it takes more that words to communicate. <strong>Mime</strong> and <strong>gesture</strong> play an important part.
<p>
Whether you <i>smile, turn up your nose or frown</i> – these signals are always correctly interpreted.
<p>
The same is true with gestures: <i>pulling your tongue out to someone, winking or bowing</i> are also signs that have a clear meaning. Isn't that so?<p><br>
<h3>Task</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain to each other what gestures or facial expressions, often accompanied by sounds, are used in your country to express the following:
<p>
<dir><em>
Approval<br>Enthusiasm<br>Happiness<br>Negation<br>Refusal<br> Astonishment<br>Horror<br>Ignorance<br>Victory<br> Disgust<br>Loathing<br>
Watch out!<br>He/She/It's crazy<br>
</em></dir>
<p><br><p><br>
<li>What can be expressed in your country
<p>
<dir><em>
with your hands?<br>with your thumb?<br>with your fist?<br>with your eyes?<br>with putting your hands to your head?<br>touching someone?<br>
with kisses?<br>
</em></dir>
<p><br><p>
If you find a sign which your are not familiar with in your country, ask your partner to show you it and practise it yourself.
<p>
<li>Also, in your mother tongue there are expressions which are referred to gestures which in actual fact are rarely if ever carried out in practice. Explain to your partner by whom they are used and what the meaning is. Can you think of other examples?
<p>

to look over your shoulder<br>to ask on bended knee<br>to tear your hair out<br>to return with your tail between your legs<br>
