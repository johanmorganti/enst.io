<h1>Bloody Hell!</h1>
<h3>Task</h3>
<P>When they get angry, are surprised or find themselves in similar situations, British people have been known to find relief by uttering <strong>curses</strong> and <strong>insults</strong>. The question is, do you know in what circumstances they can be used?
<p>
<table border=0 width=100%>
<tr><th width=15%>E.g.:<td><em>Hell's bells!</em>
<tr><td><td><em>Blast!</em>
<tr><td><td><em>Shit!</em>
</table>
<p><br><p><br>
<p>Both languages have at their disposal different ways of dealing with a person who you have fallen out with, who you hold in low esteem or who you want to get rid of as quickly as possible. But, tell me, do you know how to insult someone in English? Do you know what you are allowed to say to a woman? Do you know what can only be said to a man or a woman? What do only older people usually say? And what in some form can be uttered without seriously offending anyone?
<p>
<table border=0 width=100%>
<tr><th width=15%>E.g.:<td><em>Stupid idiot!</em>
<tr><td><td><em>Clown!</em>
<tr><td><td><em>You're barmy!</em>
<tr><td><td><em>Go to hell!</em>
</table>

<p>The truth is that it is not easy to let rip and insult someone in a foreign language. In most course books for foreigners, the authors avoid these expressions and teachers discourage their students - with good reason - from using them.
Take advantage of the work with your tandem partner to get to know when, how and by whom each one can be used.
<p><br><p><br>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p><br>
<ul>
<li>Ask your partner under what circunstances you could use the following expressions. Would he/she use them? Could you use them as a foreigner? Who would use them?
</ul>
<dir>
<em>
Swine!<br>
Bastard!<br>
Silly sod!<br>
Bugger!<br>
Bugger off!<br>
Piss off!<br>
</em>
</dir>
<p><br><p><br>
<ul>
<li>Explain to each other how you would react in your own language in the following situations. How would your parents, brothers and sisters and grandparents react?
<p><br><em>
<p>- As you are making your way towards the car, you see someone breaking your aerial.
<p><br><p><br>
<p>- Someone deliberately spills a glass of red wine over your trousers.
<p><br><p><br>
<p>- A man comes on strong with you (or with your girlfriend if you are a man) and oversteps the mark in word and deed.
<p><br><p><br></em>
<li>Write a dialogue in English and another in your mother tongue in which at least five insults or swear words occur. Give the background information of the people (job, relationship ...).
</ul>
