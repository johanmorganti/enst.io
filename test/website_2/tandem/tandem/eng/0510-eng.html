<h1>Change of identity</h1>
<p>Séan Gallagher is 20 years of age and a successful student of medicine. He can look forward to a promising future. Not only because he is intelligent, but also because his father runs a hospital and his family intends to install a surgery for him.<br>
Séan has got  three sisters and two brothers with all of whom he gets on very well.<br>
His girlfriend Maire is very pretty, intelligent and understanding and he is very much in love with her. She is also doing medicine and the two of them own a valuable collection of skeletons. Even though they are still very young, they intend to get married in the following year.<br>
However, everything changes from one day to another:<br>
After having read a couple of books about the Middle East, Séan decides to interrupt his studies, to postpone his wedding for a year and to go to Yemen.<br>
As his parents are not willing to support his plans, he sells his car and secretly he also sells the collection of skeletons which belong to Maire and himself. Then he takes the next flight and  is not heard of anymore.
After some 5 years a letter arrives in which Séan passes on his inheritance from his father to his brothers and sisters. Many years later his family learns that he has become a Muslim, that he lives in  a harem with a number of wives and 10 children..
