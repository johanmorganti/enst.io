<h1>A cuckoo in the nest?</h1>
<h3>Task</h3>
<P>Imagine, for example, that someone wants to share a flat with you or to go with you on holiday. You, however, are not (yet) totally convinced.
<p>
It is a common theme in films; people are not what they seem. <em>Single, white, female, Fatal Attraction, The hand that rocks the cradle</em> or <em>Body Heat</em>, to name just four, all show examples of people who enter the lives of others and reek havoc and destruction. You may well know people who on the surface seem pleasant and harmless but who, deepdown, can be ruthless and unpleasant. You could bear all these things in mind while you do the task.
<p>
<h3>You can begin like this:</h3>

<tr><td width=10%>A:<td>What do you think of him?
<tr><td>B:<td>Well, I don't know, what about you?
<tr><td>A:<td>I'm pretty sure it would work out okay.

<tr><td>A:<td>Go on then ...
