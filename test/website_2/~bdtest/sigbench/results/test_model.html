<b>Test model suite	(INPUT)</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A test model suite is a set of test models obtained by varying the two input
Data models with (different distributions and sample sizes), the spatial
operations and the grid shifting between the two universes (underlying map
definitions).<p>
The goal is to create a rich  set of scenarios (from the point of view of
diversity and representativeness of real life data), by changing each one of
these parameters, and analyse their impact in the performance of the
algorithms.<p>

<DT>Remarks:<p>
<DD>Grid overlapping can be meanful for operators like the intersection, but for others ones, like the Northwest operator its meaning is not relevant; so this parameter is optional.<p>
