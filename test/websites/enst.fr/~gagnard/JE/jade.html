<H2 align = center> Presentation of JADE </H2>
What proper marketing and sales strategy will your company take ? How can 
your firm optimize its position for its products in its present or new 
markets? How can it optimize its equity value, develop a financial or 
industrial policy, deal with diversification, develop a new product ? Can 
technological innovations provide your company with the solutions to its 
problems ? How could your computer network or your software environment be 
optimized ? How can your staff get proper software products for their jobs ? 
What impact will government deregulation, the EC unification, NAFTA treaty, 
or any other trade block have on your business activities in your domestic 
and foreign market ?<P>
<P>
There is certainly no easy answer to any of these questions. As members of 
the global business community, we work in an ever more complex atmosphere. 
Change is the fundamental challenge. Technology and new operational 
approaches are changing the basis of competition, governments are changing 
the rules, globalization is modifying the competitors. Superior strategy is 
even more critical than ever. It is no longer enough just to have a basic 
academic knowledge of management, marketing, financial or technological 
practices. One must have an understanding of foreign cultures and concepts, 
fluency in foreign languages, creativity, and a willingness to develop new 
managerial and technological strategies.<P>
<P>
No one understands this more than JADE and we, the Board 1995, realize the 
value of working in a business culture with orientation towards personal 
relationship, team-work, the value of learning to speak more than one foreign 
language, and the value of acquiring a knowledge of foreign social norms. 
This is certainly for us a prerequisite graduating today.<P>
<P>
The target of JADE is to bring together Junior Enterprise top students from 
all European most prestigious business and engineering Schools and 
Universities into a strong and really European organization so that the 
graduating student can be given the opportunity to begin marketing its most 
valuable asset, its practical and concrete knowledge and experience.<P>
<P>
This is certainly not easy to undertake, especially when looking at the 
present economic situation in Europe. But this allows all outstanding 
students to prove their managerial and practical value : this is the first 
chance of their life.<P>
<P>
In Europe and in the World, JADE and 
Junior Enterprises provide students with <STRONG> practical working experience
</STRONG> and the 
unique chance to develop managerial skills before leaving their university, 
enhancing their shot at finding employment and their capabilities in their 
job. Our Movement is also unique by its internal control and ethics in the 
choice and performance of projects. Because ethics is a proof of maturity and 
one of the major keys to life accomplishment.<P>
