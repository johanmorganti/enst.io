Computing, still taking its first baby steps at the start of
the 1950s, is today composed of multiple specialities.
While highly differentiated from one another, all of them
have the same objective: to automate the processing of information.

<H2>The Race for Better Performance</H2>
There is no computing without computers!
And what an amazing journey from Pascal's first rudimentary
calculating machine to the massively parallel computers of today
in which hundreds of processors work simultaneously.
Today both hardware and software improvements are combined to
optimize the performance of computers. The first are based on
improvements in architecture, while the second come from
developments in operating systems.

<H2>Software development under Control</H2>
The power of today's computers isn't easy to control.
The users expect their machines to handle ever more difficult
operations. Developing programs thus becomes sufficiently
complex that it requires the participation of dozens and even
hundreds of people. The difficulty is coordinating their work
to obtain software that is efficient, reliable, and easy to
use. This is the object of software design.

<p>
To heighten the quality of software and to keep up with the
fast changing technology, workgroups are organized, modular
software elements are used for different applications while
programming languages are more "application oriented".

<H2>The Ambitions of Artificial Intelligence</H2>

Beyond management and the calculation, computing now finds
itself involved in sophisticated tasks that require more
"intelligence". The objective of artificial intelligence
specialists is to imitate the remarkably high-performance
human brain. For example, those who study connectivity try
to reproduce neural functioning in their methods and
architectures.
<p>
The processing of natural language commands--with
applications ranging from spelling checkers to documentary
research and automatic translation--or expert systems are
other areas in which developers try to get the machine to
function more like humans. These activities lead some
computer scientists to cooperate closely with specialists
in other disciplines, such as biology and linguistics.

<H2>The Gigantic Expansion of Stored Information</H2>
The ever diminishing cost of computer memory, combined
with their ever increasing power, now allows storage
of enormous quantities of information on a single disk.
This is without value if the retrieval if stored data
can't be accomplished rapidly, which is the essential
problem of database management. Today, one can store
on a single disk all the works published in the "Pleiades"
and obtain, almost instantly, all the sentences that
contain the word "communication"!

<H2>The Mathematical Foundation</H2>
Applied mathematics provide theoretical and methodological
foundation for all the disciplines associated with computer
science, in fields as varied as operations research,
cryptography (essential for the security of systems) or
data analysis.
