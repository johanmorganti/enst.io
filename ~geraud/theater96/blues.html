<B>Tour Guide</B> - If at first you feel chilled, it might help you to realize that beneath your feet, surprisingly near, is a sphere of liquid fire, called by man the Athenosphere. Think of it as a world of lava. Or, if it suits you, think of it as <I>Hell</I>! You feel warmer already, don't you? Don't worry, you're not destined for the flames. Your sins are not that profound. No, your fate is simply to dwell in eternal Darkness. Do you feel it now? The Blackness engulfing you as we part? A deeper blackness than any of your nights upon the earth. Here, you will be soon at peace. Your eyes will grow accustomed to the resful absence of color. You will quickly forget that you <I>have</I> eyes... or ears, or <I>MINDS</I>! The turbulence and confusion of your days beneath the sun are ended. You are the nigth. Fare thee well, Shades.
