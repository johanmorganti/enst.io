<B>Annabelle</B> - No one ever told you that the secrets of the bedroom are as sacred as those of the confessional?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lonestone</B> - Yeah? What century are you thinking of? Come off it woman.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Annabelle</B> - Well, to tell you the truth, I had this same century in mind. You know, this same one from which you received twelve years of my life, of my body. Twelve years nursing your frustrations, your miseries and weaknesses in the privacy of my strength, and bearing your three children.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lonestone</B> - Look, you keep your mind on the money...<BR>
<BR>
<B>Annabelle</B> - I do have my mind on the money.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lonestone</B> - Good. I mean, what else could have been on it when it came to your turn? Damnit, you got hte same question didn't you? What is the most shameful secret you ever confided in your husband - eh? - Mrs Lonestone? And you told.
