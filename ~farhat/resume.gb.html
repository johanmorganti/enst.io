<H1> Automatic Scheduling of Applications with Temporal QoS Constraints </H1> <BR>

<BR>

<I> This thesis focuses on the support of applications that must meet
temporal Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Today, the daunting of 
translating these temporal QoS constraints into scheduling directives rests 
entirely on the programmer's shoulders.

We propose an approach in which temporal QoS constraints are
automatically translated into scheduling directives. We suggest that
the software engineer programs his application by specifying temporal
QoS constraints (expressed in the form of simple QoS equations) on the
important events of his application. These temporal QoS constraints
are automatically translated into scheduling directives.  The
application threads are partitioned into finer grain or elementary
threads to which QoS constraints are applied.  The elementary-thread
decomposition is used to guide the scheduling of the associated
user-threads. The scheduling framework involves a best-effort
cooperative scheduling based on the Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
policy.

Since our scheduling framework involves a best-effort scheduling
policy, no guarantees can be given. Applications must adapt their
temporal constraints to load variation situations by enforcing
graceful degradation or up-gradation according to specifications of
softer or harder constraints provided by the designer. In this
approach, monitoring is also available to provide enough feedback to
tune the applications and their temporal QoS specifications.

A resource sharing protocol is also proposed. It allows user-threads
to share resources without deadlocks.

Performance measurements concerning the additional cost of the
automatic scheduling are done using a demonstrator that we have
developed.  These measurements seem encouraging. They are, however,
very influenced by the number of elementary threads in the application
and mostly by the dependencies that may exist between them.
