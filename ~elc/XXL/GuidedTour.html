<b>XXL</b> is a new interactive development system for building user interfaces 
that provides:
<ul>
<li>
An interactive <b>Interface Builder</b> based on Visual Programming
<p><li>
A simple <b>Specification Language</b> that is both:
<p><ul>
<li>
Compilable by an <b>ANSI C</b> or a <b>C++</b> compiler
<li>
Interpretable by means of the <b>XXL Shell</b>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>XXL</b> does not implement a new toolkit but consists of an object oriented 
software layer which relies on <b>X-Window</b> and the <b>Motif</b> toolkit.
<p>
The <b>XXL</b> Language not only allows users to specify the widget part of the interface 
but can also be used to manage widget <b>behaviors</b> and to create 
<b>distributed interfaces</b>.

<h2>Textual and Visual Equivalence</h2>
<p>
XXL is based on the concept of <b>textual and visual equivalence</b>.
XXL interfaces can either be edited textually, visually or both in an equivalent way:
<ul>
<li>
The XXL Builder produces legible C source code in an <b>incremental way</b>
<p><li>
The XXL Builder is able to establish the <b>reverse correspondence</b> 
between the graphical objects that are created dynamically by a C/C++ program
and the <b>original source code</b> that produced these objects.
</ul>
This means the source code of a C/C++ program can be modified incrementally
when using the XXL Builder even if this code <b>was not originally produced</b> 
by the Builder. The system will always be able to retrieve the XXL interface descriptions
in the source code even if they are mixed with other C/C++ constructs and/or
if they are located in several files.
<p>
So, textual and visual programming can be alterned at any stage of the development
process: for instance XXL Interfaces can be specified textually, then modified visually, 
then modified textually again and so on in any order. This capability apply
for C, C++ and XXL Script files, thus allowing a truly iterative development scheme.
<p>
<br>

<h2>Three-View Edition</h2>
<p>
The XXL Visual Builder is based on a 3-view paradigm:
<ul>
<li>
the <b>Widget View</b> shows the graphical user interface(s) (GUIs)
<li>
The <b>Text View</b> shows the source code that corresponds
to the active GUIs
<li>
The <b>Graph View</b> is an abstract iconic representation of the GUIs
</ul>
All three views are <b>linked together</b> and are updated 
in an <b>incremental way</b> (any change in any view is immediately reflected
in the other views).
<p>
The Graph View is fully editable and is handled in a direct manipulation style.
<p>
The Text View can be modified by directly editing the source code.
These modifications are locally performed "on the spot" (the source code is not
entirely re-interpreted but just the subpart that has been changed).
<p>
<br>

<h2>Complete Motif Resource Editor</h2>
<p>
The <b>XXL Builder</b> provides a complete <b>Resource Editor</b> that 
can show and modify interactively almost all the resources of Motif widgets.
<p>

<p>

<h2>Liveness: No Building and Testing Phases</h2>
<p>
There are no "building" and "testing" phases: the GUIs displayed in the Widget View
are <b>always active</b> and the user can interact with them in the usual way.
When editing C or C++ programs, the three views are
<b>modified dynamically</b> while the program is running.
Re-compilation is just needed at the end of the edition process.
<p>

<p>

<h2>The XXL Specification Language</h2>
<p> 
Besides the fact that it is both interpretable and compilable
the <b>XXL Specification Language</b> is also intended to be
simpler and much concise than usual X-Window or Motif code.
In fact, it can be considered as a kind of <b>"Simple Motif"</b>
in that sense that it respects the general philosophy of the Motif toolkit
while hiding or simplifying many implementation details.
<p> 
As Motif GUIs consist of trees of  widgets, we have decided to adopt a list 
formalism to represent the textual descriptions of XXL objects. 
So, each XXL object is represented by means of a list whose first member 
indicates the class of this object. The following members of the list depend on 
the meta-class of the considered object. For instance, in the case of widget objects, 
the class name must be followed by the name of the newly created instance
 and by the possible children of this object (if any). The parenthood between 
XXL objects is thus implicitly defined. 
<p>

<h2>Script files and Prototyping</h2>
<p>
XXL Interface description are not only C-compilable but can also be <b>interpreted</b>
by means of <b>xlsh</b>, the <b>XXL Shell</b>.
XXL Script files can be executed in the same ways as usual Unix Scripts (by specifying
the proper shell at the first line of the script file).
This feature provides a simple way to add simple graphical interfaces to Unix commands
or other programs (the XXL Language provides simple mechanisms to call
Unix commands and exchange data with them).
<p>
Furthermore, XXL Scripts can also be used for <b>early prototyping</b>.
Here, the major difference with other scripting language (like for instance Tcl/Tk)
is that this text can then be <b>directly included into C or C++ source code</b>
without any modification or translation. And of course, interactive modification
of this code will still be possible by using the XXL Builder.

<h2>Run-Time Interpretation and Distributed Interfaces</h2>
<p>
Scripts files can also be <b>dynamically loaded from C/C++ programs</b>,
in which case the included descriptions are interpreted at run-time. 
These descriptions can then access the call-back functions of the program 
and share static variables with it.
<p>
Moreover, XXL Interfaces can also be <b>exchanged dynamically</b> between 
<b>separate (possibly remote) programs</b>.
The corresponding descriptions are sent through the network 
by using sockets and are interpreted at run-time by the receiving program.
This mechanism can also be used for modifying widget resources,  updating variables
or executing functions that reside in remote programs.
<p>

<h2>Compilation and Interpretation</h2>
<p>
It is interesting to note that this system mixes compilation and interpretation:
<ul>
<li>
Interfaces located in C/C++ files are initially compiled, but they are also
<b>dynamically post-interpreted</b> when editing them visually
with the XXL Builder (this means that interpretation is guided by the dynamical
data created through the compilation and the execution processes)
<li>
Interfaces located in XXL Script files are interpreted by the XXL Shell
<li>
Interfaces loaded at-run time or exchanged between separate program
are also interpreted by the library version of the XXL Shell.
</ul>


<h2>XXL Classes: Graphical and Abstract  Objects</h2>
<p>
XXL follows an object-oriented architecture.
XXL components are not limited to widgets (the graphical objects) but
also include objects for specifying widget presentation and behavior,
widget layout and control statements (such as conditions and repetitions).
<p>
New XXL subclasses can be derived from these predefined classes
in order to integrate into the XXL systems widgets other 
than those primarily provided by the Motif toolkit. 
<p>
Lastly, XXL  Interfaces can be decomposed into a hierarchy of <b>Sub-Interfaces</b>.
Interfaces (or Sub-Interfaces) can be encapsulated into "pseudo-classes".
and be considered as if they were a single object. This mechanism helps to structure 
the whole interface into homogeneous and reusable subparts. 
<p>

<h2>Behaviors</h2>
<p>
Besides call-back functions, XXL provides several ways to specify
various behaviors:
<ul>
<Li>Implicit Behaviors
<li>Conditional Evaluation
<li> Active Values.
</ul>
(to be completed)
<p>

<h2>Implicit Type Conversion and Expressions</h2>
<p>
Widget resources have internal representations which are all different 
(for instance a "size" will be represented by an integer, a "color" will be a
numerical index in a color map, a "string" may even be encoded by means of a 
special purpose representation in order to take into account various kinds of languages). 
XXL provides a double conversion mechanism that is able to transform most resource 
values into standard ASCII strings and vice-versa. This single feature can considerably 
simplify interaction between widgets as it avoids having to write callback functions 
(whose only role would be to convert resource values into different types).
<p>
Moreover, complex expressions can be computed by evaluation and concatenation
of (converted) widget resource values, the data returned from the evaluation of
Unix commans, etc.

<h3>Application Specific Objects</h3>
<p>
XXL includes an optionallibrary that includes functions and objects to deal with
images, icons, graphs and low-level graphical primitives (lines, rectangles, circles, etc.).
XXL provides objects that let the user deal with simple graphical primitives 
as if they were actual widgets. This library also includes functions that 
can read and display images  and manage the color tables in an appropriate way. 
<p>
Furthermore, it is also possible to make widgets movable under certain conditions
The following figure shows a graph made of movable icons. 
These icons are linked by arrows that follow the icons when 
moved interactively by the user.
