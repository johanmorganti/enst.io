INSTALL File for SUN (SunOS4 and SunOS5/Solaris2) Workstations

==============================================================

o) WARNING:

The XXL package requires :

- SunOS4.x or SunOS5.x (= Solaris2) depending on the distribution file
Note that:
  * SunOS5.4 or more is better (on Solaris workstations)


- X Window version X11R5 (or X11R6)
Note that:
  * XXL will probably NOT work under X11R4 (an obsolete version of X)
  * the default "openwin" server on SunOS4 workstations is based on X11R4
    (this means that a more recent X server must be used)
  * the default "openwin" server on SunOS5/Solaris2 workstations is based 
    on X11R5 (thus it will work properly with XXL programs)


- Motif version 1.2.x (it is better to avoid x = 0 !) or CDE
Note that:
  * Motif 1.2 and CDE are based on X11R5 (thus, as said before, X11R4 is
    inapropriate)


- A "standard" window manager: mwm (Motif), dtwm (CDE), olwm, olvwm (OpenLook)
Note that:
  * the "fvwm" window manager should work fine (if properly configured)
  * the "ctwm" window manager will probably NOT WORK (for "some reason"...)


- Backing Store (only for the XXL builder)


NB: "best configuration" (= the one used for developping XXL) :
  SunOS5.5 (= Solaris2.5) / the "openwin" server / the "mwm" window manager


==============================================================

1) CREATE a new directory, for instance:  /usr/local/XXL
   From now, we will call it the "XXL directory"


==============================================================

2) UNCOMPRESS and UNTAR the proper distribution file in this new directory:

   For instance (for SunOS5) :
         gunzip xxl-96-5.tar.gz
         tar xvf xxl-96-5.tar

This will create the following directories :

config	: configuration files
include	: include files
lib	: libraries
bin	: binary files (xlbuild, xlsh, xlpad ...)
samples	: C examples
scripts	: XXXL Script examples
iman	: files for the XXL Builder incremental manual
doc	: documentation (quite poor for the moment ...!)


==============================================================

3) CONFIGURATION:

- go to directory XXL/config

- edit file "ConfMake" :

by defaut, file file starts with :

XDIR  = /usr/openwin
XMDIR = /usr/dt
XLDIR = /usr/local/XXL
CC = gcc

You may have to modify these macros so that :

XDIR   will be the ACTUAL XWindow directory on YOUR system
XMDIR                     Motif
XLDIR                     XXL

CC must be an ANSI C (or C++) compiler (default: the "gcc" GNU compiler)

Note: 
you can also install the XLDIR directory under your own home directory
if you don't have Root permissions to install it on /usr/local


==============================================================

4) COMPILATION

- return to the XXL directory

- type:  make

This should :

- update the librarie in the XXL/lib directory (in order to take account
of the XLDIR macro specified in the XXL/config/ConfMake file)

- compile the binary files

- compile the sample files

- make the iman files
Note that this stage will only be performed if the "man" Unix command
  and the Motif manual pages are properly installed on your system
  (this means for instance that command "man XmPushButton" is supposed 
   to return the complete manual of the Motif PushButton widget)


==============================================================

5) BINARIES and SAMPLES

You can now run the various C or Script samples :

*** in directory XXL/bin:

- "xlbuild" is the XXL builder

- "xlsh" is the XXL Shell (this program interprets XXL Script files)
  (see more information below in: "directory XXL/scripts")

- "xlpad" is an example C program that displays SunRaster or GIF images
Note:
   this program (and other XXL programs) can be run under two different
   modes:
   * to run this program in "normal mode": 
                 just type its name ("xlpad") from the Unix Shell

  *  to run this program in in "Builder Mode" type:
                 xlpad -build
     then open the "Interface" menu to edit the corresponding interfaces

- "xlget" and "xlsend" are sample programs that illustrate communication
  between remote XXL applications (start "xlget" first with a port number
  as an argument)


*** in directory XXL/samples

This directory contains various sample C programs that can either be run :

- in "Normal Mode" :    just type their name

- in "Builder Mode":    type their name followed by option -build


*** in directory XXL/scripts

This directory contains various XXL scripts files that can either be run :

- by typing their name from the Unix Shell
  (if the "xlsh" shell is at the right place in the file system)

- by typing their name with option -build

- by typing:   xlsh script_name   or   xlsh -build script_name
  ("xlsh" is the XXL Shell)

- by running xlbuild (the XXL Builder) and opening the XXL Script file 
through the "Load" button of the "File" menu
