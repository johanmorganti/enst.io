Descriptions on classes:

Fireborns are supposed to be fire spirits.  They're closely in tune with
magic and are powerful and learn magic easily.  Being fire spirits, they
are immune to fire and poison, and vulnerable to cold.  They are vulnerable
to ghosthit and drain because being mostly non-physical, anything which 
strikes directly at the spirit hits them harder....

  Quetzalcoatl's are now born knowing the spell of burning hands, but
because of their negative wisdom bonus, they have a very hard time learning
new spells.  Their maximum natural wisdom is 13.  With the high intelligence
bonus, they will typically have many spellpoints.  They can be very
devastating at low level due to their low natural ac and can make mincemeat
out of low-level monsters.  However, at midlevel, they really begin to have
problems because they cannot use armour.
