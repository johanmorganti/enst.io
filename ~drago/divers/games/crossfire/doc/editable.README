Editable groups:

One item can belong zero or more groups. Editable doesn't really mean 
that item is meant to use in the maps, but rather that is possibly use 
it in the special circumstance. It's preferred to use random items 
as treasures in the maps.

Rather, the value of editable determines what category(s) the item
is put in in crossedit.  For example, if the editable value in the 
archetype, then the item will appear in the monster area under 'arch'
in crossedit.

Also, when looking at this table to determine what the value of
editable should be, it is 2^(num-1).  That is to say if you want
it to appear in the 'shop' menu, it would be 2^6 and not 2^7.

Asterisk(*) marks groups that are really editable.
