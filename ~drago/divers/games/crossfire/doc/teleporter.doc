           triggered teleporters

By default, teleporters teleport anything which steps
on them to x,y,map (see map editor)

If you'd like to make teleporters trigger off of 
something, you must:

make sure that the teleporter object has a speed of 0.
pentagrams have a speed of zero by default, other
teleporters must be modified using the map editor

give the teleporter a connected value.  You may use
any object to trigger the teleporter.  This includes
magic ears, which recognize words, buttons, levers,
altars, pedestals, perhaps even monsters.

When the connected object is triggered, the teleporter
will trigger also, teleporting whomever is on it
someplace.
