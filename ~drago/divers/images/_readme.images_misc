     File: _readme.images_misc
Directory: images_misc
------------------------------

This directory contains images that you can view on your workstation.  
There are different types of images for different types of monitors.
View 1-bit images on black and white monitors.  View 8-bit images
on either color or grayscale monitors.  View 24-bin images on color
monitors for true-color, 24-bit image display.

IMPORTANT: THESE IMAGES CAN ONLY BE RUN UNDER SUNVIEW.

Viewing Images
--------------

There are two ways to view the images: one at a time, or you can
run a script which will display all the images in the directory
in sequence.  The im1 and im8 directories have quite a few images 
so you may choose to view them one at a time if you want to see 
only a few images.  Follow the directions below for the type of 
monitor you have.


Quitting the Scripts
--------------------
To quit the scripts, press Control-C.  The screen will redisplay.


Black and White Monitor
-----------------------
If you have a black and white monitor, you can view the images in
the im1 directory.  To view the file named kitty.im1, enter the
following command:

	% cd im1
	% screenload kitty.im1

To view all the images in this directory, run the runme script:

	% /cdrom/images_misc/im1/runme

The script will continue forever (unless you press Control-C);


Color or Grayscale
------------------
If you have a color or grayscale monitor, you can view the images in
the im8 directory.  For example, to view the file named suncolor.im8,
enter the following command:

	% cd im8
	% screenload suncolor.im8

To clear the image from the screen, use the "Redisplay All" option 
from the SunView root menu.

To view all the images in this directory, run the runme script:

	% /cdrom/images_misc/im8/runme


Color
-----
To view the file named castle.im24 enter the following command:

	% cd im24
	% screenload castle.im24

To clear the image from the screen, use the "Redisplay All" option
from the SunView root menu.

To view all the images in this directory, run the runme script:

	% /cdrom/images_misc/im24/runme


Image Files
-----------

The images are stored in rasterfiles appropriate for 1-, 8-, and
24-bit framebuffers.  These images have been dithered and processed.  
The im1, im8, and im24 subdirectories contain 1-bit, 8-bit,
and 24-bit images, respectively.
