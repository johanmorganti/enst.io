# ENST.IO

**Live website here : https://enst.io**

---

This came from the idea of reviving the first website (at least, first one saved) from Telecom Paris, aka Telecom ParisTech aka ENST. The source being http://www.enst.fr in 1996 / 1997.
I tried to do some minimal modification to the code, mainly the 2 changes are :

* rename SRC paths to relative one to not rely on `enst.fr` domain
* Add banner for people to come here

Next steps are :

* Continue to update broken links
* List all subdomains used and back them up as well
  * `www-inf` : https://github.com/johanmorganti/www-inf.enst.io
  * `www.stud`
  * `www-elec`
  * `www-ima`
  * `res`
  * `www-ima`
  * `aist`

Feel free to contribute to improve it!
