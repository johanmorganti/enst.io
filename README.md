# ENST.IO

This came from the idea of reviving the first website (at least, first one saved) from Telecom Paris, aka ENST. The source being http://enst.fr in 1996 / 1997.
I tried to do some minimal modification to the code, mainly the 2 changes are :

* rename SRC paths to relative one to not rely on `enst.fr` domain
* Add banner for people to come here

I tried different method to retrieve this website, other attempts are under /tests.

Feel free to contribute to improve it!
