<h1 align=center>ANNUAL REPORT, 1995</h1>


<h2>MISSION</h2>

<p>UNESCO Chair's Mission is to provide wider opportunities for the transfer of
the knowledge and know-how in the field of engineering sciences. Therefore,
the Chair is acting like a "student" organisation, that strives for
excellence, by serving the needs of individuals and institutions.

<blockquote><b>
Opportunities, competence and commitment are the three dimensions of our
mission statement.
</b></blockquote>

<p>The Chair's major goal is to become acknowledged leader for the value it
offers to its "students", and the rewards it offers to its professors.

<p>To accomplish this mission the UNESCO Chair is guided by its vision of the
future, a focus on its "students", the need for the higher skilled and
motivated organisational team. The Chair envisions a new educational service
unit - one of great challenge and equally great opportunity, instantaneous
communication and intense competition.

<p>The prospect for growth in the University "Politehnica" of Bucharest is
excellent, driven by the ever more sophisticated and complex needs of the
"students". This trend enables the UNESCO Chair to act also as an
appropriate link between other specialised chairs.

<p>The UNESCO Chair's strategies begin and end within its "students". Progress
will be measured by how well the Chair earns the necessary loyalty for long
term relationships that provide the foundation for the Chair's success. The
Chair will win "student" loyalty by providing value-added courses,
differentiated by unique expertise and responsiveness.

<p>Success will require new skills and ability to permanently respond
competitively to the rapidly changing needs of the "students". Therefore,
the UNESCO Chair must seek out the most talented people and the newest, most
resourceful ideas. It will combine entrepreneurial perspective, technology
and discipline in order to focus its resources creatively and efficiently.

<p>The UNESCO Chair's final goal is to become an important link in the network
of University Chairs coming under UNESCO, to align itself at the
international standards of education and training in the world.
