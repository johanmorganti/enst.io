This page is dedicated to my friend Matthias Schmitt (M/S) also called Matze Bock because he always feels
like screwing a girl (what is by the way totally human). The nice shot was taken in occasion on his trip to Paris when 
visiting me. The girl next to him is called Alexia and he awfully felt in love to her these days... but she flew...
to Pennsylvania/USA. Can a girl escape M/S ???<br>
Surely not. He will take a flight to the US to see her over there in a few months, yes, yes, some recuperation is 
needed, he's no inhuman guy.<br>
Today I got a very interesting message from M. Bock when he visited for the first time this page and I have to
include this as a quotation:<br>
<i>"(... When I come to Pennsylvania, ...)"</i>


due to vast protests of M. Bock I was forced to cut out a very phunny part
of the quotation. I hope you enjoy this page although.
In any way, feel free to contact me via EMail to get more infos about
details. (he he he)

<i>"by the way: what the hell means "recuperation"? I have never heard a 
word like this! but again thanks again for the nice picture! tell 
some mor news, did you meet Alice before she went to the states?" </i>
