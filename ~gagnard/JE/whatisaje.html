Paris decide to create an association.

at low prices</EM>. The first Junior Enterprise was born.<P>

 Encouraged by their early success, the Junior Enterprises endowed 
themselves with National Confederations to preserve the use of the JE trade 
mark as a warranty of service and reliability as well as represent the 
Junior Enterprises before national authorities and promote the Movement.<P> 
<P> 
Junior Enterprises are associations established with an economic purpose, 
managed by business or engineering students, at the service of firms. Their 
mission is to carry out study projects as an extension of the training 
offered in the Universities and Grandes Ecoles through actual practice and 
confrontation with the economic concept, realities and difficulties.<P>

<P> <H3>Concept</H3>
The Junior Enterprise concept is based on non-profit organizations whose 
activities are characterized by the performance and management of projects 
originating from companies or institutions. The activities of a 
Junior-Enterprise aim at professionalism in projects and organization. 
This should be done through both quality and perspective regarding project 
performance, project management, and management of the Junior Enterprise.
<P>
<H3> Organization</H3>
An organization called Junior Enterprise is an association or foundation 
which is linked to a university or school. A Junior Enterprise and its 
operationally active administrators are completely independent of influences 
that are outside national and international confederations of Junior 
Enterprises. A Junior Enterprise distantiates of political and religious 
issues, and refrains from any form of discrimination.
<P>
<H3>Project</H3>
A project is a sequence of unseparable activities that are bounded by a 
convention and are carried out at fixed financial and temporal conditions, 
using a specified methodology. A project aims at realizing objectives that 
have been detailed in advance in a specification document. A project is 
finalized by th e transfer of created intellectual goods.
<P> 
<H3> Performance and Management</H3>
Project performance, project management, and management of a Junior 
Enterprise are done by students originating from a university or school. 
These educational institutions provide in full-time education, following 
on secondary education, concluded after a number of years as specified by 
the national confederation. The performance and management of projects must 
give added value to the theoretical knowledge or practical experience of the 
students. Project performers and project managers care for realizing the 
specified objectives of a project ; the former do this by means of research 
and the latter by means of guidance. The performance and management of a 
project can be remunerated. Junior Enterprise managers take care of the 
creation of an environment in which projects can be performed successfully. 
The management of a Junior Enterprise cannot be remunerated.
<P>
<H3>Recommendations</H3>
To achieve solid implementation of the Junior Enterprise concept, the 
methodology that is recommended by the national and international 
confederations of Junior Enterprises should be used for performance and 
management aspects. An organization that qualifies for all criteria of a 
Junior Enterprise is strongly recommended to use the trademark Junior 
Enterprise and its brand. Preferably, a Junior Enterprise only handles 
projects that involve disciplines belonging to the educational programme of 
its university. Administrators of a Junior Enterprise are firmly advised to 
be mainly involved in management.
