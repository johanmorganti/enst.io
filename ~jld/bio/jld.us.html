<h3>Conversation Modeling : the PTC</h3>
Amazingly, the most spontaneous use of natural language : everyday
conversation, seems to be the most constrained one. Our Problematic
Theory of Conversation (PTC) makes some of these constraints explicit :
any utterance must establish or diminish some problematics
(inconsistency, improbability, undesirability). The PTC predicts that
otherwise a severe breakdown will occur in the conversation. The PTC is
not a mere descriptive model. It leads to a generative model of
conversation. Making use of PTC general principles and of a totally
declarative knowledge base, our program PARADISE-2 is able to
reconstruct a real conversation.<br>

<h3>Computer Assisted Learning</h3>
Can we learn with a computer ? Maybe, in three ways. The computer may be
a laboratory, a huge multimedia database, a teacher... or colleague. Our
approach : the computer as a critic. Making use of the PTC principles,
our program SAVANT3 is able to argue with the student when a problematic
(inconsistent, undesirable) situation occurs.<br>

<h3>
Evolution of communication
</h3>
The study of the pragmatics of human communication gives
results that can be applied in HCI (Human Computer Interaction).
Computer Assisted Learning is one example. When one tries
to get artificial agents to communicate in a useful human-like 
way, however, 
one has to answer further questions like "What is the main <i>function</i>
of human communication". 
<br>
A brief examination that would depict human communication as
a simple cooperative exchange of information would bring us
to a paradox. Human communication would not be stable from
an evolutionary point of view.
We are trying to discover, by means computer simulations based
on <i>Genetic Algorithms</i>, under which conditions human-like
communication may emerge and remain stable.
