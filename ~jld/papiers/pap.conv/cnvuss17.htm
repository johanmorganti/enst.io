Discussion and conclusion</H1>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>We suggest that topics and replies are highly constrained during casual
conversation. Topics must be problematic, and replies have to strengthen or to
reduce this problematic aspect. However, things may be slightly more complex as
far as replies are concerned, mainly because replies call for further replies.
In fact, there is little to be added : reinforcements, banalizations,
invalidations and antagonistic reactions may follow one another, as we can
verify on the excerpts given in this paper. For instance in [ex_doors p.13],
the antagonistic reaction A4 follows the invalidation B3. But there are several
other, logically minor, possibilities to give relevant replies, and we go
through rapidly now.<p>
We did not mention agreements. We had some in the same excerpt [ex_doors] (B4
and B6). However, the importance and frequency of agreements, at the logical
level, should not be overestimated. For instance from a logical point of view,
replies like B1 or B2 in [ex_thirst p.18] are not agreements but banalizations,
as we saw. We should also mention replies that make the complex explicit, or
ask for an explicitation. We had such utterances after every breakdown we gave
as example, but also in [ex_Goffman p.6] A6, or below reply B3.  Lastly, they
may be more complex patterns, when interlocutors introduce " meta-arguments ".
Consider the following excerpt.<p>
[ex_ping-pong]<p>
<i>context: A is amazed at the strange technique of a Chinese student who is
playing table tennis.</i><p>
<i></i>A1- T'as vu comment il tient sa raquette ?<p>
B1- C'est un Chinois, les Chinois ils tiennent tous leur raquette comme a<p>
A2- C'est pas naturel ! Comment ils arrivent &agrave; jouer ?<p>
B2- Oh ! C'est pas un sport a !<p>
A3- Enfin, tu transpires !<p>
B3- Un sport o tu cours pas, c'est pas un sport.<p>
<i>[&Eacute;]</i><p>
<i></i>A5- Mais comment ils font pour smasher, les Chinois ?<p>
<p>
<i>A1- Did you see how he holds his paddle?</i><p>
<i>B1- He is Chinese. They all do the same</i><p>
<i>A2- It isn't natural! How do they manage to play?</i><p>
<i>B2- Oh ! you can't call it a sport</i><p>
<i>A3- Well, you do sweat</i><p>
<i>B3- If you don't run, it isn't a sport</i><p>
<i>[&Eacute;]</i><p>
<i>A5- But how do the Chinese succeed in smashing?</i><p>
<i></i>Here B2 is a meta-argument. First A1 is intended as a paradox (as A2 and
again A5 clearly show). But B take it as an improbable event, and banalizes it
with B1, which cannot of course make A satisfied. With B2, something else
happens : if table tennis is not a sport, then the previous topic about the
holding of the paddle is no longer interesting. The ensuing discussion is a
meta-conversation only because the interestingness of the initial topic is at
stake. To all other aspects, it is a normal conversation (notice the
invalidation A3, and the effect of B3 which is to make a clause of the logical
context explicit). Only in A5 do interlocutors come back to the initial
topic.<p>
The analysis of this excerpt illustrates how our model can be used to
understand the internal structure of conversations. Not in terms of acts or
intentions, but in terms of logic. Usual theories of discourse or of
conversation pay more attention to the interlocutors themselves and to their
intentions than to the content of their utterances. This is perfectly
legitimate, and allows to make interesting predictions (<i>e.g. </i>conditions
of satisfaction of verbal acts, typology of negotiation, etc.). We tried to
show however that some constraints may exist between <i>arguments</i>,
regardless of who uttered them<a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[7]</a>. This point of
view gives a very different perspective. For instance, when B in [ex_doors
p.13] suggests to use a wire brush, his intention is certainly to be helpful.
However, the effect of his argument is to invalidate A's reasoning. If A uses a
wire brush, then the inference from <i>burning off the old paint </i>to
<i>repainting is tough work </i>is no longer valid. Cooperation, intention,
conversational goal, all these concepts commonly used in the study of
conversation have no meaning at the level of the logical organization of
arguments. Arguments have " their own life ", which obeys strong constraints.
Interlocutors are for the major part unaware of the logical constraints they
put on the other's arguments or on their own. We believe that the study of
their intentions and of their discourse strategies should take advantage of a
previous analysis of the argument logical structure the way we propose here.<p>
The model presented in this text has given rise to some technical developments.
We are currently developing a computer program that tries to generate arguments
that have been uttered in real conversations, using a knowledge base containing
knowledge about the subject [Dessalles 1990]. We also designed a Computer
Assisted Learning program that sustains conversations in the paradoxical mode
with students [Dessalles 1991]. We believe that besides its potential value as
theoretical reference for technical applications in human-machine verbal
interaction, this model of the logical structure of conversation may generate
several research programs, that we already begin to explore. More work is
needed to delimit the scope and validity of the model, to establish
quantitative experimental evidence, to study developmental aspects (how logical
constraints are learnt, if they are learnt at all), cultural variability,
disorders<a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[8]</a>, etc.<p>
We are by nature reluctant to accept that our freedom is not as wide as what we
believed, especially during <i>free</i>, spontaneous conversation. Anyone
making a close examination of the content of what we say in everyday
interactions must however admit that the rules of the conversational game are
very strict, and that they often dictate our next move, depending on what we
know of the subject. There are often not many ways to be logically relevant.
Such constraints on our verbal behavior, like other constraints observed at
other levels (linguistics or social), can no longer be ignored.<p>
