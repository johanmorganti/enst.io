The natural use of natural language </H1>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Everybody is involved many times a day in conversations. Sometimes when
we stop talking and begin to listen, we can hear the incredible noise made by
other speaking humans. We spend much time in this linguistic activity which
seems to be a distinctive characteristic of our species. So it is quite
surprising to observe that spontaneous conversations are the object of a
limited number of studies compared to the huge number of papers devoted to
other aspects of natural language (e.g. syntax or semantics). Indeed several
authors consider that most models of "higher" aspects of language are still
unsatisfactory (e.g. [Trognon &amp; Brassac 1988:212]). H. Bunt [1991] puts it
this way : <p>
"dialogue theories need other devices than, say, constituent structure diagrams
and truth-conditional semantic rules. Instruments are needed to model such
things as what each of the partners knows and believes and what communicative
intentions they pursue. The representation of such things and how they can be
used by an intelligent linguistic agent to perform successfully in a dialogue
is far beyond the means of traditional linguistic theories".<p>
Are all aspects of conversations so complex that they appear totally
unconstrained ? The aim of this paper is to suggest that we may find some
reliable structure if we look at the content of arguments. Some scientists do
study higher aspects of natural language without making use of any corpus, e.g.
Discourse Analysis (see [Coulthard 1977]) and many studies using the paradigm
of Speech Acts [Searle 1969]. However for our purpose, such a limitation would
be an obstacle. Our approach is closer to the <i>Conversation Analysis</i>
method for at least one reason : we consider unconstrained conversation as a
natural behavior that has to be studied as it occurs, and thus we decide to
work only on data gathered on real situations. All the excerpts given in this
paper come from conversations that really occurred (for discussions about
differences between these approaches, see [Reichman 1989], [Goodwin &amp;
Heritage 1990], [Moeschler 1990], [Norman &amp; Thomas 1991]). <p>
Conversations can be studied from very different points of view. Many authors
are concerned with more sociological aspects : rules governing turn taking (how
we know if we can or even must utter a reply at a given moment), conversational
style (describing recurrent differences between speakers), how social relations
are expressed in conversation (e.g. dominance, aggressiveness, politeness,
cooperation), what kind of social acts are performed during conversation, etc.
Other authors are more concerned with micro-features of conversations:
interruptions, intonation, hesitations, etc. [Clark 1995]. Some others study
relationships between structure and function in conversations : how
explanations, complaints, etc. are expressed through utterances, how decisions
or truth are negotiated in interaction, and so on. For instance Drew &amp; Holt
[1987] show how idiomatic expressions are used under certain circumstances to
express and summarize complaint during conversation ; Reichman [1985] tries to
identify " a conversation 'deep structure' in terms of structural relations
between discourse elements " ; Heritage [1990] shows how explanations are
expressed depending on the social situation.<p>
Our approach is closer to this last trend. In the present study, we are looking
at the content of utterances, trying to describe how they are functionally
linked together and with the topic. On one side, we are not describing social
aspects of conversations. We do not even consider the intentions of
interlocutors. Our concern here is, as A. Trognon puts it, conversations, not
people involved in conversation. On the other side, we are considering the
content of arguments, not wording details. The model we will present will allow
us to make some predictions about what an utterance can or cannot express at a
given moment of a conversation.<p>
But what do we consider here as a conversation ? An extreme position may be to
consider that every naturally occurring use of language has to be considered as
a conversation. Our aim is of course much more limited : our results come from
the observation of typical casual conversations, with the following
characteristics :<p>
-	speakers with equal status<p>
-	relaxed speakers<p>
-	speakers knowing each other well<p>
-	speakers meeting frequently<p>
-	speakers not involved in a task-oriented conversation <p>
-	speakers being (at least momentarily) serious<p>
The extension of our model to other types of interactions is not
straightforward. Suprisingly, it appears that casual conversations seem to be
more constrained than less relaxed dialogues (cf. [Dessalles 1992a]), like a
quarrel between wife and husband (as in [Schank &amp; Lehnert 1979]), or work
dialogues (such as operative language or dialogues occurring during design
activities, studied for instance by Falzon [1991]). In contrast, our own data
consist mainly of more than 30 hours of family conversations involving most
often more than three adult speakers. This approach to conversation claims to
be "ecological", since it starts from the unprejudiced observation of human
beings behaving normally. Some of the recordings were made "secretly", but most
of the time the recorder was placed on the table and quickly forgotten, even by
the observer. It was  simply presented in fact as a way of taking a "sound
photo". <p>
I was always present and often participated in these recorded situations. One
may be surprised by the fact that I did not keep my distance from the data. But
this was necessary for at least two reasons : first it is understandable from
an ethical point of view, and secondly, as we shall see, it is the best way to
have a<b> </b><i>perfect knowledge of the context</i>, and it was thus the only
way we found to gain some insight into some of the rules governing
conversations. But we will also use here data from other corpora whenever it is
possible.<p>
This last point which concerns the context must be stressed : our study of
logical aspects of argumentation in spontaneous conversations begins as soon as
the context is known. Having currently no way to extract relevant contextual
knowledge, <u>we study only conversations for which this context is
unambiguously known</u>.<p>
