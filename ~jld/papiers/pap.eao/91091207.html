Abstract: 
</ul>
<ul>

The SAVANT 3 system has been designed to help engineering students of 
Telecom Paris to learn new concepts by themselves. The original feature
of this system lies in its dialogue module which tries to sustain "natural"
conversations with the student. The two main objectives pursued are
acceptability (by the student) and simplicity (for the author). 
The imitation of mechanisms occurring in spontaneous conversation 
allowed us to approach these two goals.
