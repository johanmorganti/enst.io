<h4>
Abstract
</h4>

<ul>
The increasing demand for engineers in fast changing specialities requires new
ways of teaching technics in higher engineering education. But introducing computers
as ordinary learning tools is far from being simple. For the past ten years, we have
been exploring original ways of using new technologies to help students learn new
concepts. The solutions experimented in Telecom Paris by engineering students
include an hypertext encyclopedia, a multimedia network system, and an Intelligent
Tutoring System which tries to sustain "natural" conversations with students. All
these systems were designed for the same specific purpose: to help the students learn
new technical concepts by themselves.
