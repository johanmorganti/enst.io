Most developments in the area of computer assisted teaching address the problem of helping students acquire new procedures or skills. Acquisition of new concepts, and correction of misconceptions detected during problem solving, is often considered as irrelevant or un important.
<p>
However engineers have to adapt continuously to a rapidly changing world. Merely mastering a few skills proves to be insufficient. Precise knowledge of technical concepts is also essential.
<p>
Presenting conceptual knowledge in a context of skill acquisition or of problem solving may be of course a good way to teach concepts. But this approach is not the only one, and should involve a qualitative measure of student's performance: errors are indeed important and complex events that are often linked to underlying misconceptions.
<p>
We will present the SAVANT 3 system that was specifically designed to teach  concepts. This system is able to argue with the student about technical  notions. Our aim is to reproduce the kind of relation that may exist  between a student and a human private teacher. We believe that a good way to achieve this is to try to mimic argumentation as we observe it in natural conversations.
<p>
SAVANT 3 is still in development. Its main feature, compared to other ICAL  systems, is that authoring time is reduced: less than 20 logical rules are typically necessary for SAVANT 3  to discuss about a given topic.
