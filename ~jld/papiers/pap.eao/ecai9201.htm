Logical Aspects of Surprise</H1>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Previous studies on the logical aspects of argumentation in
natural conversations (see [dessalles 1985, 1990]) showed that people quite
often introduce a new topic by uttering surprise. Consider for instance the
following excerpt:<p>
<p>
[ex_canteen]<p>
context: A, B and C are choosing a table at their staff canteen. A is surprised
because there are very few people, when it's normally quite difficult to find a
table free. B gives an explanation: most of the students went to the so-called
"forum" where companies present job opportunities.<p>
<i>A:	What happens today? There 's nobody here. It's Wednesday...</i><p>
<i>B:	Today is the forum day.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
This kind of surprise, where one realizes that the situation does not match
one's expectations and where <i>reasons</i> can be given to justify such
expectations, appears as essentially logical. In this excerpt, A had reasons to
think that students should have been more numerous: it was wednesday, and they
had to attend classes. This expectation is in contradiction with the small
number of students. A's surprise thus comes from an expectation.<p>
It is possible to capture such expectations with a simple logical
representation (such a logical representation can be made more precise at will,
but it is not necessary here):<p>
<p>
normal_workday ==&gt; <b>not </b>students_are_absent<p>
<p>
Some expectations are the result of logical reasonings, as was shown for
instance by Inhelder &amp; Piaget [1979] when they insisted on the difference
between procedures and structures. In one experiment with children, they put
pearls one after the other into two containers alternatively. The two
containers were shown to contain initially a different number of pearls, and
one of them was then hidden. Smaller children considered as possible that they
contain the same number of pearls after some time, when older children
considered such an event as <i>impossible</i>. One of them declared: "Oh yes:
as soon as you know, you know for ever!" (<i>"Ah oui: une fois qu'on sait, on
sait pour toujours"</i>). The authors concluded: <p>
<p>
<i>structures show themselves through inferences made by the child while
procedures involve much more empiricism; and the structural nature of these
inferences is best revealed by suppressions of contradictions and of
incompatibilities.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
So people have structures that allow them to draw inferences and thus to have
expectations about the world (as was also recently emphasized by Ohlsson
[1991]). For our purpose, we can consider these structure as logical models. Of
course some expectations are not the result of logical inferences. They may
follow for instance statistical measurements. But <i>model-based surprise
</i>(caused by logical expectations) seems much more likely to be followed by
an explanation, and thus we chose to focus on it.<p>
