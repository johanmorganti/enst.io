<HR>
<P>It is often said that there are significant differences between families in different countries.
<H2>Task</H2>
<P>The task today consists of finding out if this true or whether it is just one of those things that people say.
<P>So, ask your partner to describe what he/she considers to be an everyday British family and explain to him/her how you see a typical family in your country. (Why don't you use your own families as examples?)
<P>
<P>Don't forget details like
<UL>
<LI>members of the family (parents, children -- others?)
<LI>family relations (parents -- children, parents -- grandparents, ...)
<LI>daily routine (hours of work, mealtimes ...)
<LI>earnings and family responsibilities (children's earnings?)
<LI>household chores (who does what?)
<LI>free time (together, separately ...)
</UL>
