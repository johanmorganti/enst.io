<h1>New Products</h1>
<p>The multinational company <b>FUTUREMARKET</b>  wants to open new markets as sales are down on its traditional products (school stationary, young fashion, electrical goods for the home and leisuretime) due to the competition from other companies.<br>
In order to survive the crisis and to be able to extend and change its range of products, <b>FUTUREMARKET</b> has started a competition..
<p>
The participants are asked to
<ul>
<li> suggest completely new products
<li> suggest  variants of already existing products which have a different form , characteristics or function from the original.
</ul> 


At any rate , the participants must describe the new  <b>characteristics</b>  and the <b>advantages </b>of the products.<br>
The following example illustrates the task for the participants:
<p>
 
A new product could be a<b> book</b>
<img align=right src="../../pict/logo1.gif">
<ul>
<li><i>with the  features of a ball</i><br>
<b>round</b>, so that one can play with it after reading it (since most books are not read all that often)<br>

<b>waterproof </b>,so that it can be read while having  bath
<li><i>which is lacking essential parts</i><br>
<b>without pages</b>, so that it can be used as a container
<li><i>made of unusual material</i>:<br>
<b>made of steel</b>, so that it can be used as a safe.
</ul>
<b>Task: Take part in the competition and describe the products in English.</b><br> (Of course your partner has to do it  in German.)

A proper competition has to have an incentive  to take part in it. Think of five (if possible unusual) prizes for the best suggestions made by the participants.
