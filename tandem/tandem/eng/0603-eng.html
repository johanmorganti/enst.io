<h3>Task</h3>
<P>Since time immemorial man has enjoyed conjuring up an imaginary world very different from the real world, a world with roles reversed, in which other physical laws, etc. operate. It could be, however, that this topsy--turvy world is in many cases the right way round, don't you think?</P>
<P>Write out something similar with your partners: in the form of poetry, or a list of wishes (<I>Wouldn't it be marvellous if ... </I>), or in the form of an amusing tale (<I>Once upon a time ...</I>), because we're sure you will have better ideas.</P>
