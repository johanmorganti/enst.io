<h1>Living in Britain</h1>
<p>As one would expect, not all your life revolves around college. Certainly, your personal habits and characteristics are, or can be, a reflection of those of the country. For this reason they are very important because they will give your British partners first hand information about the people of a country they hardly know.</P>
<p>Therein lies the task: to learn to know each other better in order to widen horizons, to get along better and--why not?--to appreciate each other more.</P>
<P>With this single aim in mind, here are some questions to put to your partner. When you answer in turn don't think only about yourself but rather about the "norm", that is to say what most of your friends do.</P>
