<LI>Imagine that the world is your oister: a millionaire's bank balance, all the time in the world, choice of company ... <strong>-- how would you spend your holidays?</strong><br>
Of course, it may be that you have already experienced an unforgettable holiday. What was it like?<br>
Describe to your partner <em>in your own language</em> the journey, the place, the people, the atmosphere -- in short, all that strikes you as important. Don't be afraid of fantasising, of exaggerating.<br>
Your partner will take notes accordingly, and you will do likewise when he/she is talking<em> in English</em> about his/her dream holiday.

<LI>It is possible that your dreams coincide, but also that they may be totally different. However it turns out, you've now got to <strong>plan your holiday together</strong> -- ideal or real -- so that both of you can get the best out of it.
