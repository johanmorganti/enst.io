<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">It is up to you!!! If
you want our opinion we'll give it to you later on. Now we want
to help you decide. How? by showing the pros and cons: </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Advantages</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Let's begin with the
advantages of using your mother-tongue: it is easier , it will
probably make you feel more comfortable and confident, you will
not make mistakes and thus provide a good model for your
colleagues, etc. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Disadvantages</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If you use the foreign
language, you will have to work much harder and you may produce a
poor model for the other participants from your country that take
part in the Forum. The problem is that using your own language
you will be more passive and ... we want you to be active! You
have many opportunities to be passive: you can always sit down at
home on your favorite armchair and read the lyrics of your
favorite band's last record. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Our Opinion</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Which ever language
you choose you have to feel at ease and be aware of the
difficulties your colleagues may find when trying to decode the
last idiom that came to your mind while trying to be natural and
colloquial. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If you are a beginner,
we are afraid all you can do is being passive and wait patiently
until you have the necessary tools to write in the foreign
language. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif"><b>Recommendation</b></font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Always remember that
the two languages must be used, so help to keep the balance! </font></p>
