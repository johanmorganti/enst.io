 <I>"A la Carte"</I><br>Spatial Joins Benchmarking
</h1></center>
<P>Spatial joins are join operations that involve spatial data types and
operators. Spatial access methods are often used to speed up the
computation of spatial joins. Our work addresses the issue
of <b>benchmarking</b> spatial join operations.<br><br>
If you are concerned with experiments then you can ask for<BR>

<b>generating data sets</b></A> of rectangles - that one could see as
"Minimum Bounding Rectangles" (MBR) of geographic objects
- by  specifying the number of rectangles, as well as their distributions
with regard to size, shape, and location.
Various common statistical distributions are supported for that purpose.
A rectangle set generator of our own can provide you with a wide choice of
'A la carte' rectangle (MBR) sets.<br>
The output format will be a table of rectangles described by four coordinates

</TR></TABLE></center><BR>
one rectangle per line, starting with the outer boundary of the whole
set.<br><br>
To see an example, you can <b>vizualize the SEQUOIA sample #16</b>
<br>either as a

with an O2 DBMS on a SunOS System10 platform:<br>
Using our rectangle set generator we have defined several test suites
to compare the performance of three spatial join algorithms:
nested loop ("ScanScan"), scan and index access ("ScanIndex")
and synchronized tree traversal ("IndexIndex"), for operators: INCLUDES,
INTERSECTS, NW of...<br><br>
We plan to implement soon : scan and grid access ("ScanGrid") and "HashJoin".

Our main goal is to build, at the end of this exchange process between you
and us, a <b>Minimum collection of rectangle sets</b> to become a practical
workload for the whole GIS research community, having carefully proved it as
sufficiently rich, statistically speaking, to exhibit variance of
behaviors between different Algorithms for different Spatial Join Operators.
