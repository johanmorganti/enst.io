Replying with a banalization</H2>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>When an improbable or an (un)desirable topic has been introduced,
one may reply by diminishing the intensity of the modality : the event is not
so improbable afterwards, or it is not so much trouble, or it is not so nice
(of course this possibility does not exist in the paradoxical mode). There are
several ways offered to the interlocutors to achieve this. <p>
[ex_sailing]<p>
<i>context: discussion about a French skipper who competed in the America's cup
challenge, with the support of many people in France.</i><p>
<i></i>A1- Alors Marc Pajot s'est fait &eacute;craser encore.   <p>
B1- Deux minutes, c'est pas &eacute;cras&eacute;!   <p>
A2- Deux minutes quarante secondes, si.   <p>
C1- Oui, mais enfin, tu sais, hein, il a quand m&ecirc;me tenu le coup jusqu'au
dernier moment, hein, lui.   <p>
A3- Quel coup?   <p>
C2- H&eacute; ben enfin, il a pas sombr&eacute;, il est pas tomb&eacute;, il
est arriv&eacute;!   <p>
A4- Tu veux dire qu'il est arriv&eacute;, il est arriv&eacute; en demi-finale
<p>
C3- en demi-finale, &eacute;coute!   <p>
<p>
<i>A1- So Marc Pajot was beaten badly once more.</i><p>
<i>B1- Two minutes, you can't say he was beaten badly</i><p>
<i>A2- Two minutes forty seconds, yes he was.</i><p>
<i>C1- Yes, but you know, he was in the running till the last moment, wasn't
he?</i><p>
<i>A3- What kind of running?</i><p>
<i>C2- Now, he didn't sink, he didn't fall, he finished!</i><p>
<i>A4- You mean, he reached the semi-finals</i><p>
<i>C3- Yes, the semi-finals, it isn't that bad!</i><p>
<i></i>B1 is a banalization. It does not deny the fact that M. Pajot was
beaten, nor the undesirability of this fact, but the intensity of the latter.
In the improbable mode, things are a bit more complex, but nevertheless very
interesting because they are in total agreement with what formal probabilities
predict [Dessalles 1993]. A first strategy consists in mentioning additional
facts that increase the <i>a posteriori</i> probability according to Bayes
rule.<p>
[ex_thirst]<p>
<i>context: A and B are speaking about D, their great child. D (one year old)
seems to remember them after a separation of several months. B claims not to be
surprised : the boy laughed when hearing their voice at the phone. A few
seconds later C notices that D swallows a big quantity of water.</i><p>
<i></i>A1- Apparemment, il nous avait pas oubli&eacute;s.   <p>
B1- Non. Il nous a pas oubli&eacute;s quand ... il riait aux &eacute;clats
quand il entendait notre voix.<p>
[pause]<p>
C1- H&eacute; ben, il avait soif!   <p>
B2- Oui, il avait soif. Je m'en suis dout&eacute;, qu'il avait soif!   <p>
<p>
<i>A1- It seems that he didn't forget us.</i><p>
<i>B1- No. He didn't forget us when ... he laughed when he heard our
voice.</i><p>
<i></i>[pause]<p>
<i>C1- Gee, he was thirsty!</i><p>
<i>B2- Yes, he was. I suspected that he was thirsty!</i><p>
<i></i>The first topic is about a child (D) that A and B see after a long
separation. D is so young that it was <i>a priori</i>  improbable that he could
remember them. A1 brings information, in the Shannon sense. B1 does not
invalidate the reasoning leading to <b>IMPR</b> in any way. We may represent
the logical context this way :<p>
[ <i>young</i>( D ) <b>&amp;</b> <i>long_separation</i>( D, <i>A_and_B </i>)
<b>&amp; not </b><i>forgot</i>( D, <i>A_and_B</i> ) ]  =&gt; <b>IMPR</b><p>
<b></b>The additional knowledge underlying B1 may be represented by :<p>
<i>laughed_when_hearing</i>( D, <i>A_and_B</i> )  =&gt; <b>not
</b><i>forgot</i>( D, <i>A_and_B</i> )<p>
So B1 performs no invalidation. On the contrary, it seems to confirm A1 ! This
excerpt is quite remarkable, because B shows exactly the same behavior with C
one second later, on the next topic. C is impressed by the quantity of water D
is swallowing, and thus brings information by focusing on an  improbable fact.
B2 seems once again to be a confirmation.<p>
Many authors consider only cooperative aspects of conversation, in which
information and confirmation play important roles. However, at the logical
level at which we look at this excerpt, we can see that B's utterances, in both
cases, do not merely acknowledge the interlocutors' statements. It is very
important to see that B1 and B2 do much more : they aim at <i>diminishing the
originality</i> of A1 and C1 respectively. What A and C assert is not so much
the event they noticed as its <i>a priori</i> improbability. B twice changes
this probability. After B1, for instance, Prob(<b>not </b><i>forgot</i>) has to
be replaced by Prob(<b>not </b><i>forgot </i>| <i>laughed-when-hearing</i>),
which is much greater (it is actually equal to 1 if we consider that
[<i>laughed </i>=&gt; <b>not </b><i>forgot</i>]). In other words, with the
knowledge that D laughed when hearing A and B, it is much less improbable that
he remembers them. Again with B2, B simply indicates that the probability of
the little boy being thirsty was for her not so low since she suspected he
was.<p>
We can thus anticipate several ways for a speaker Y to perform a banalization
by raising the <i>a priori</i> probability P(Ev<sub>0</sub>) of a given event
Ev<sub>0</sub> reported by X as improbable. Y can simply indicate that her/his
own estimation is above X's, as was the case in B2 :<p>
Pr<sub>Y</sub>( Ev<sub>0</sub> )  &gt;&gt; Pr<sub>X</sub>( Ev<sub>0</sub> )<p>
Y can also reveal that (s)he knows additional facts F<sub>1</sub>, ...
F<sub>n</sub> so that:<p>
Pr ( Ev<sub>0</sub> | F<sub>1</sub>, ... F<sub>n</sub> ) &gt;&gt; Pr (
Ev<sub>0</sub> )<p>
as was the case in B1. But there is yet other possibility, as we show with the
next excerpt.<p>
[ex_loud] (from [Tannen 1984:101])<p>
<i>A1- Speaking of which they had the Loud Family. Remember the Loud Family? On
Saturday Night Live?   </i>[TV program]<p>
<i>B1- What was the Loud Family? </i><p>
<i>A2- Dju hear about that? THEY TALK LIKE THIS. </i><p>
<i>B2- I know lots of people in New York who talk like that. </i><p>
<i></i>In this case B increases the empirical frequency of the fact which has
been presented as improbable by A. Using his own sample (people he knows), the
fact is no longer unique or even rare. This strategy may give rise to so-called
<i>story rounds </i>[Tannen 1984] that everyone has experienced : <A NAME="Index11"></A>
after a first story telling some improbable event, the next speaker tells
another story about an analogous event. The more analogous, the more efficient
it is as a way to reduce the information brought by the first story (both
events belong to the same universe of events). However, the second story leads
most of the time to a topic change, since listeners forget about the first
story, and the new topic is then considered as an improbable fact in itself.
Another similar story will come as banalization, and so on. Notice that the
similarity between stories is a requirement of banalization.<p>
Interlocutors may use the full range of what formal probabilities predict in
order to perform a banalization in the improbable mode. For instance, in order
to banalize a dated fact, it is better to mention a similar fact that is
recent, since an old fact may imply that the frequency is still low (this is
consistent with what a Poisson law suggests).<p>
There is a last way of making a relevant reply, which is by nature limited to
the (un)desirable case.<p>
