Improbable topics</H2>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>We are going to model first a kind of conversation which occurs
very frequently: conversations that start with the mention of some unusual
event. This includes current facts (we feel compelled to draw attention on the
fact that a tortoise is walking through the garden), or past "incredible"
stories. All these facts share the property of being <i>a priori
</i>improbable, and this is precisely what we should expect if we look at
conversations using the Shannon paradigm. [ex_antenna, p.9] was a typical
example of this : at that time, parabolic antennas were pretty seldom on
private houses, and seeing one in the neighborhood is worth a conversation.<p>
How can we link this to the Shannon model ? Spontaneous conversations are often
presented as an information exchange. But what exactly is information ? We wish
to use this term here in its narrow meaning as it was established by Claude
Elwood Shannon [Shannon 1948]. The amount of information brought by a symbol
coming from the message source is measured by <i>log(1/p)</i>. In this formula
<i>p</i> stands for the symbol <i>a priori</i>  probability. Thus a very
improbable event (reception of a rare symbol) produces much information when it
occurs. This was actually the case for " there is a parabolic antenna nearby ".
This requires that the mentioned event is <b><u>re</u></b>cognized by the
receptor (here the addressee). It means that the addressee has be able to
assign an <i>a priori</i> probability of each event that may be mentioned ! We
hold now a first condition for a topic to be relevant : <p>
<center><i>An event that will be considered as </i>improbable <i>by the
interlocutors makes a relevant topic for conversation.</i><p>
<i></center></i>This allows to make some predictions. If you tell to a
colleague that you saw a car in front of your workplace that is strictly
identical to yours, this will provoke a breakdown (" So what ? "), since the
event is not very improbable (we assume you do not have an uncommon car). If
you tell that you saw <i>n</i> cars identical to your own, it will make a
conversation for <i>n </i>sufficiently high (depending on your acquaintance
with the colleague).<p>
It would be interesting to study how such probabilities are assessed (see
[Dessalles 1993]). We may just suggest here that they involve an egocentric
point of view (thus the importance, in the example, of the antenna being
located in the neighborhood). The transposition of the Shannon model is
particularly suggestive and fits very well with our data. More precisely, it
allows to express constraints on what can be replied after an introduction in
the improbable mode, as we will see. Let us turn to another criterion for
relevance.<p>
