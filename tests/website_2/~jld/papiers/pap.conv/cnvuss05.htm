 Logical context and conversational breakdowns</H1>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>We will call <i>logical context</i> this part of the shared knowledge
which is necessary (for us and also for the people involved in the
conversation) to determine the relevance of what is uttered. This concept of
logical context could be thought to be non-operational. How can we decide what
in the shared knowledge should or should not be part of the logical context,
when this context is not made explicit by the speakers? Fortunately a procedure
exists which gives an experimental way to bring it out. In case of
conversational breakdown, the first speaker makes spontaneously some elements
of the logical context of her/his intervention explicit. It is thus quite
simple to provoke such a breakdown in order to get elements of the logical
context : simply say "So what?", "Why do you want to know?", "Why do you say
this?", or "What are you getting at" (your difficulty has to appear clearly
motivated, or else answers may be different, involving aggression or humor).
This procedure may occur naturally, or may even be performed as a thought
experiment. Let us see a few spontaneous examples.<p>
[ex_Mercedes]<p>
<i>context: On the highway from Paris to Germany. Big Mercedes are common. B
does not notice that the Mercedes just passing had a Hungarian license number.
At the time, when Hungary was a communist country, individuals were supposed to
be not rich.</i><p>
<i></i>A1-  T'as vu la Mercedes ?<p>
B1-  H&eacute; b&eacute; quoi ?<p>
A2-  Tu savais que les hongrois, ils avaient des voitures comme a ?<p>
<p>
<i>A1-  Did you see the Mercedes?</i><p>
<i>B1-  So what?</i><p>
<i>A2-  Did you know that Hungarians had such cars?</i><p>
<i></i>Elements given in A2 (Hungarians were not supposed to own big cars)
allows to isolate the logical context from shared knowledge unambiguously:<p>
<i>Hungarian</i>( <b>X</b> )  =&gt; <b>not</b> <i>rich</i>( <b>X</b> )<p>
[<i>owns</i>( <b>X</b>, <b>Car</b> ) <b>&amp;</b> <i>big</i>( <b>Car</b> )]
=&gt; <i>rich</i>( <b>X</b> )<p>
In the next excerpt, we observe an ironic reply as a consequence of a
misunderstanding about the context, which will be made more explicit by the
first speaker.<p>
[ex_antenna]<p>
<i>context: 1987 near Paris; parabolic TV antennas are very rare on private
houses, while every house has its "comb" antenna.</i><p>
<i></i>A1- Tu sais, j'ai vu une antenne sur une maison de la rue des Roissys<p>
B1- Dis donc, quel &eacute;v&eacute;nement!<p>
A2- mais non, une antenne comme... une antenne parabolique<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A1- you know, I've seen an antenna on a house of the Roissys street</i><p>
<i>B1- gee, what an event!</i><p>
<i>A2- but no, an antenna like, a parabolic antenna</i><p>
<i></i>Something interesting happens here : there are two contexts, "A saw a
'comb' aerial in the neighborhood", and "A saw a parabolic antenna in the
neighborhood", but only the second one makes A1 relevant while the first one,
which is what B perceived, provokes the ironic reply B1. The relevance of A1
comes clearly from the fact that seeing a parabolic antenna in the neighborhood
is <i>a priori </i>very improbable (while it is not the case for usual
antennas). It seems that pure logical formalism is unable to  represent the
meaning of A1-A2. That is why we introduce a new modality, <b>IMPR</b>, which
denotes a highly improbable fact. So we get something like:<p>
[ <i>parabolic_antenna</i>(<b>X</b>) <b>&amp;
</b><i>neighbourhood</i>(<b>X</b>) ]  =&gt; <b>IMPR</b><p>
Here ( p =&gt; <b>IMPR</b> ) simply means that p is <i>a priori</i> highly
improbable. The variable <b><i>X</i></b> denotes any object, since the
assessment of the <i>a priori</i> probability holds for any object and not only
for the specific object A saw. We saw another example of spontaneous breakdown
in [ex_lunch, p.6]. In this excerpt A did make the logical context (Christmas
special lunch) explicit, but this was not recorded. Here again, we need a
special modality to represent a crucial element of the logical context :<p>
[ <i>chrismas_lunch</i> ]  =&gt; <b>DES</b><p>
( p =&gt; <b>DES</b> ) means that p is <i>a priori</i> desirable. We just saw
examples of logical contexts, and we saw that this context may be made explicit
after a breakdown. Sometimes the logical context is spontaneously made explicit
by the first speaker before other participants ask for it. We could observe
this phenomenon in [ex_Goffman, p.6], where the logical representation of A6
was exactly an instantiation of the logical context of A1 (with <b>X</b>
instantiated to A).<p>
It is worth noticing the epistemological importance of such breakdowns. We see
clearly from our examples that these breakdowns were not caused by any trouble
at the semantic level : the meaning of the preceding utterance was not
ambiguous. In [ex_lunch] for instance, B had perfectly understood the meaning
of the question, but refused to answer. As we will see, the trouble was
essentially <i>logical</i>. It is also amazing that <i>no pragmatic theory is
able to predict such breakdowns</i>. Sperber and Wilson [1986] try to define
the conditions for relevance, but in a way which is not convenient here since
none of the examples we gave is detected as non relevant. The addressee can
easily infer new propositions from " I've seen an antenna ", or " I came by
train ". (S)he could have simply answered the questions " Did you see the
Mercedes " or " Did you have a good lunch " from which they also could make
many inferences. Unfortunately, the observation (and also our intuition)
indicates that these utterances <i>were not</i> relevant in the situation in
which they occurred, and Sperber and Wilson fail at predicting this phenomenon.
The definition of logical relevance that we will give here successfully
predicts logical breakdowns.<p>
