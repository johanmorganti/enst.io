What a topic can't be</H2>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Three different ways of introducing a relevant topic have been
illustrated for now. It is of course essential to get the complete gamut of
admissible topic initiations. The main prediction of the model is that, for the
kind of conversations considered here, at least one of the three effects evoked
above : improbability, paradox, (un)desirability, is required.<p>
<center><b>First principle of logical relevance :</b><p>
<b></center><center></b><i>Every conversation is built on a problematic
<br>(improbable, paradoxical, (un)desirable) event.<br>A non-problematic topic
will be irrelevant.</i><p>
<i></center></i>Such a limitation could be surprising. Could we not think of
other kinds of introductions ? Before asserting that there are obvious
exceptions that do not fit the model, the reader is invited to imagine them in
context. Could we have for instance a conversation starting with a mere true
statement, or with the expression of an opinion, without any intention of
mentioning a paradoxical or improbable or (un)desirable event ? This may be
possible for other types of conversations (in experimental or goal-oriented
situations). However the model presented here with the three above modes fits
very well with the data of our corpus, and we claim that it may apply to most
unconstrained situations (as defined previously p. 4) accurately.<p>
These constraints on topic introduction in spontaneous conversation is a
predictive, and therefore falsifiable, model. The breakdowns observed in
[ex_train p.6], [ex_lunch p.6], [ex_mercedes p.9] and [ex_antenna p.9] are
predicted by our model : in each case the addressee had no means to perceive
the event as problematic<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[3]</a>. As we noticed,
these breakdowns are predicted by no other pragmatic theory<a name="fnB3"
href="#fn3">[4]</a>. It is easy to get such a breakdown, just by mentioning any
event which is not problematic, even if this event is in some way related to
the current situation (as it was the case in [ex_train]).<p>
The above principle is claimed to be also valid when the topic is introduced
with a question. Notice that new topics are quite often introduced in an
assertive way, unlike what some models seem to take as granted<a name="fnB4"
href="#fn4">[5]</a>. Nonetheless questions are frequent. We observed several of
them, in [ex_Goffman p.6], [ex_mercedes p.9] or [ex_lunch p.6]. In such case
the first speaker has a precise idea of at least one possible answer or of some
of its characteristics, and this expected answer must lead to something
problematic (either paradoxical, or improbable, or (un)desirable). Furthermore,
the listeners most of the time need to be aware of this anticipation [cf. Fox
1987:375]. For sure we may ask questions for which we have no precise idea of
the answer: "What is the capital of Burundi?". But one has again to imagine
such a question in situation, as a way to introduce a new topic. What would be
said after a reaction like "Why do you want to know ?" ? According to the
model, the first speaker would then reveal a problematic situation. It may go
from an undesirable lack of instantiation (e.g. if the speaker is doing
crosswords) to a more structured problem (e.g. some inconsistency when reading
a novel about Africa). But even the lack of instantiation has to be
specifically problematic. In other words, <i>the model excludes unmotivated
questions</i>.<p>
We may represent the logical context that characterizes the problematic issue
by the following relation :<p>
[ p<sub>1</sub> <b>&amp; </b>p<sub>2 </sub><b>&amp; . . . &amp;
</b>p<sub>n</sub> ]  =&gt;  <b>MOD</b><p>
where <b>MOD </b>represents one of the modalities <b>F</b>, <b>IMPR</b>,
<b>DES</b> and <b>UND</b>, and where all the <i>p<sub>i</sub> </i>are believed
to be true. We will refer to this relation by the term <i>problematic clause<A NAME="Index2"></A></i>.
<p>
We have now to investigate further by studying the constraints that limit the
range of relevant replies that may be uttered after a relevant (<i>i.e.
</i>problematic) topic has been introduced.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn2" href="#fnB2">[3]</a> This term does not take the desirable mode
into account, but it is a convenient way to summarize how a new topic should
logically appear.<p>
<a name="fn3" href="#fnB3">[4]</a> Actually some models based on plan
recognition [Grosz, Pollack &amp; Sidner 1989], [Scholtens  1991], [Young,
Moore &amp; Pollack 1994] may be able to provoke a breakdown when no plan is
recognized. Such models, used this way, would be much too restrictive,
rejecting many relevant topics introduced in the improbable or the paradoxical
modes, for these modes do not involve any plan.<p>
<a name="fn4" href="#fnB4">[5]</a> For instance in the IRF model of
conversation structure, which is often mentioned ([Coulthard 1977:135]; [Stubbs
1983:136]; [McTear 1985:35]), the role of initiation is most often played by a
question.
