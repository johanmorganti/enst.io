Paradoxical topics</H2>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>All natural conversations do not function in the improbable mode.
In other words,  one cannot consider each initiating utterance as carrying
information, in the restrictive Shannon sense (just consider the utterance : "
Hey, you're are there! "). We will describe here a kind of conversation that
everybody can experience daily : conversations that go around an amazement,
beginning for instance with "That's strange..." or "I never understood why...".
We had two examples of such conversations : [ex_Goffman, p.6] and [ex_mercedes,
p.9]. In each case, the first speaker is amazed, because incompatible facts are
observed to be simultaneously true :<p>
[<i>knows</i>( <b>X</b>, Goffman's_books) <b>&amp; not</b> <i>sociologist</i>(
<b>X </b>)] =&gt; <b>F</b><p>
 [<i>owns</i>( <b>X</b>, <b>Car</b> ) <b>&amp;</b> <i>big</i>( <b>Car</b>)
<b>&amp; not</b> <i>rich</i>( <b>X</b> )] =&gt; <b>F</b><p>
In each case, the topic was not introduced as an event of infinite rarity. The
first speaker tells of a fact which appears to her/him as a paradox, as a
contradiction between the observed fact and what he knows, but not as a
rarity<a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[2]</a>. In each case the logical context
allows the interlocutors to draw the negation of the uttered event through a
logical proof : B was <i>a priori </i>expected not to know Goffman's books
because he was not a sociologist ; Hungarians were expected not to own big cars
because they were known to be poor. This is why we speak of contradictions, or
paradoxes.<p>
We will see below other reasons to make a qualitative difference between
paradox and improbability, and not to consider the former as a limit of the
latter. One of these lies in the different forms of replies that are admissible
in both cases. But for now, we hold a second condition for a topic to be
relevant : <p>
<center><i>An event that will be considered as </i>paradoxical <i>by the
interlocutors makes a relevant topic for conversation.</i><p>
<i></center></i>This again allows to make some predictions. Think of such a
paradoxical fact, turn one term of the contradiction into its opposite, then
tell the resulting situation to somebody and see the result (<i>e.g. </i>" I
saw an Hungarian, he had a small car ").<p>
We have yet to observe another kind of topic introduction that is yet quite
different from the two preceding ones.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn1" href="#fnB1">[2]</a> Some facts presented by locutors as
paradoxical can even be frequent.
