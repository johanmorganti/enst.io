From I.T.S. to I.C.S. : Learning with an Intelligent Critic, Not with a Tutor

<h4>
Summary
</h4>

<ul>
Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) seem very attractive as learning tools, because they ideally replace a personal tutor, keeping in their records (student model) many characteristics of each individual learner: what the learner knows, what he ignores or wrongly knows, his preferred way of learning (inductive vs deductive, autonomous vs guided, ...), and so on. 
<p>
Unfortunately I.T.S. are to be found mainly in research laboratories, not in classrooms! The reason for this is that their design is very difficult, especially on university level topics.
<p>
In TELECOM-Paris we are trying to design another type of intelligent teaching aid which should be considered rather as a critic than as a tutor. This approach should be indeed more appropriate in a university context where students are able to learn mostly by themselves, but need specific help when experiencing a particular problem (conceptual puzzle, abnormal behavior of some device, repeated failure).
