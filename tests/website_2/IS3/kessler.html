<P>Of the marketing nullity [nullite' marketing?] of personal computers</P>

<P>There is a balance to be struck in Multimedia between the cdrom and the
Internet, a balance very similar to that which must be struck between
the media of print and digital information generally: each must yield
much ground to the other, although in each case there is room for both.</P>

<P>Heavy bets are being made now in the commercial and financial markets
on the new "NC": the "Network Computer", or "Non - Computer" -- the
limited - capacity "Internet box" terminal which will be produced this
year by Oracle and perhaps by Apple and others for US$500 -- which
may well be provided to the ultimate consumer free of charge by the
BabyBells and others, as the Minitel was originally.</P>

<P>The technical capacities of the NC / Network Computer / Non - 
Computer and the Internet may not be enough yet to support Multimedia the way
cdrom does. But technical capacity is not what drives a market: the
ability to reach customers does -- the marketing. The Internet's new
"general public" customers may settle more for the Multimedia of the
Internet -- dictating the new standards -- if and to the extent that
they are better - reached by the efforts of the much less expensive
"Internet and the NC / Network Computer / Non Computer" marketing
package, than they are by the comparatively now much more expensive
"cdrom and personal computer" marketing package. So Multimedia, so far
as it is linked to the cdrom, and the personal computer generally, both
are in some trouble in the commercial and financial markets now.
