<H3>4.00 And, tools --</H3>

<P>The best way to find things about "Multimedia" or anything else online,
as these things multiply and change, is to become familiar with and to
use the online indexes: among these are --</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF = "http://http://www.altavista.digital.com">http://www.altavista.digital.com</A> -- DEC's "Altavista", currently the
largest and fastest;

<LI><A HREF = "http://http://magellan.mckinley.com">http://magellan.mckinley.com</A> -- "Magellan" offers its own very useful
judgments about which sites are good and no - so - good;

<LI><A HREF = "http://http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</A> -- "Yahoo" offers good subdivided indexing, for
narrowing down searches;

<LI><A HREF = "http://http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dreiling/smartform.html">http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dreiling/smartform.html</A> -- "SavvySearch"
allows you to pursue a single search easily over multiple search
engines;
</UL>

<P>-- try searching these for "Multimedia", but then when you retrieve for
example "Altavista's" 900,000+ entries, try looking at the various
sophisticated ways which these search engines offer for narrowing your
search -- the problem no longer is too little information.</P>


<A NAME="How"><H2>B. How to get them</H2></A>

<H3>1.00 From France</H3>

<P>Internet Service Providers / ISP's (sometimes called Internet Access
Providers) are plentiful now in France: the <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo Internet index</A>
(http://www.yahoo.com) currently lists over 50 in France. Many can be
found online and in Minitel listings. Most large French institutions
now offer some form of Internet account to anyone having a proper
affiliation: universities, government departments, large corporations,
research institutes, bibliothe`ques municipales, and, thanks to RENATER
and other recent government programs, nearly any institution of "higher
learning" in the country.</P>

<P>Users in France and elsewhere also have the option of using the Minitel
to reach the Internet: try 3615INTERNET or 3616EMAIL or 3619USNET (the
last is Rupert Murdoch's Delphi Service).</P>

<H3>2.00 From the US</H3>

<P>ISPs now can be found in most places in the US. The most recent
entrants are the "BabyBells", which began offering Internet service
including WorldWideWeb/W3 at very low consumer prices this Spring.</P>

<H3>3.00 From Anywhere Else</H3>

<P>As of January 1996 there were 9,472,000 Internet hosts in the world,
any one of which might support very many individual human users [ref.
<A HREF = "http://http://www.nw.com">http://www.nw.com</A>].  These hosts may be found in or reached from nearly
any country possessing some form of telecommunications system. This is
not to say that the many political and economic and social problems of
access have been solved in all places, or even the technical problems.
But radio modem access is in use now in Cambodia, and there is Internet
access now to Mozambique. There are few places on the globe now which
digital multimedia cannot reach: whether it will or should are other
questions.</P>

<H3>4.00 How to stay up to date -- continuing education</H3>

<P>One has to stay in touch daily: the technology changes this fast, and
radically. It is too much to ask most users to remember to "dial in" to
a Webpage or other online sources on a regular basis. The easiest
device for staying up to date is a good, firmly - disciplined,
electronic conference: they will send you regular and hopefully
relevant and self - controlled and limited email announcements and
discussions, which you can browse through with your morning email
work.  Several examples of such electronic conferences which are
concerned specifically with "multimedia" are suggested above. There are
thousands of others available, concerned with thousands of other
subjects.</P>

<H3>5.00 A General Note:</H3>

<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>how to get online: you need only --
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> a "computer". Nearly any computer, "mac" or "dos" or "W95" or
other:  "desktops" will work, but so will "laptops" and some
"palmtops", and later this year there even will be the "NC", which
stands for "Network Computer" but already is being called the "Non -
Computer" -- "desktops" and "laptops" cost $1000 to $2000 in the US,
"palmtops" come in various capacities and prices, the "NC" is predicted
to cost $500 in the US and may be provided free to consumers (a` la
Minitel);

<LI> a "modem". 28,800bps speed is the current norm. External modems are
available, into which you plug your "computer", but increasingly modems
are internal standard equipment. The most convenient is a little
"PCMCIA card", the size of a thick "carte aux puces" which simply slips
into a slot in the side of your "computer".  Speeds are increasing,
prices are dropping ($150 in the US now): one day modems may not be
needed, thanks to ISDN / Nume'ris etc., but for now they are necessary;

<LI> "telecom software". Most "computers" have basic dialing software as
standard equipment now, included in the price. You will need in
addition, though, WorldWideWeb / W3 interface software: some variety of
the "Mosaic" interface developed originally at the University of
Illinois. Many varieties of "Mosaic" are available now, some free of
charge and some for sale: the best / biggest for now is "Netscape",
which may be purchased ($50 in the US), or downloaded for free from
many places on the Internet, including  <A HREF = "http://http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</A> ;

<LI> an "Internet account". You should get a "PPP" ("Point - to - Point
Protocol") or "SLIP" ("Serial Line Interface Protocol") Internet
account, from your institution or from a commercial ISP / Internet
Service Provider. (There are very many "ISP's" now in France and
everywhere else. They all are basically the same although they charge
very differently. In the US current charges run $19 per month with no
extra charges for access, time, or taxes. Most French universities,
government ministries, and large institutions of any type offer their
own internal "PPP" accounts now, though.) You will "connect to the
Internet" (including W3) most often simply by making a telephone call
to it, using your "computer" and its modem, a` la Minitel;

<LI> your time. There is really very little which must be learned by you
in order to make very effective personal and professional use of the
Internet / W3 -- taking very little of your time -- although there is a
great deal (too much) which may be learned if you wish to. The best
suggestion is for you to keep your own short list of the few "commands"
which you really need -- from among the great variety available which
you will read about or hear about from friends -- and then use your
list when you are "online". This will avoid much of the "information
overload" which you hear so much about.
</OL>

<LI> how to stay online:

<P>The greatest problem in learning to use online information is the
necessity of practice: much of the skill is not intellectual but
manipulative and manual -- you are training your hands rather than your
brain, the repetition of typing or the pianoforte rather than the
process of thinking, and so you must practice. Several online tools
will enable you to retain the skills which you acquire initially:</P>

<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> e - mail. Effective, regular use of email currently is the most
personally - productive, and easiest, means of staying online and
practicing. Increasingly anyone anywhere in the professions, business
or government has an email address:  the best initial practice is to
gather such addresses -- increasingly these are on business cards --
and use them rather than written letters or fax, and certainly rather
than voice telephone (which reaches only answering machines now). Unix
email is easy to learn if you wish to store your materials online. Many
software packages are available now as well for operating email from
your own "computer";

<LI> e - conferences. The electronic conference, in your profession or
discipline or area of interest, will send you regular information of
interest to you via email, guaranteeing that you practice your online
techniques, and even allowing you to get and stay up to date in your
own subject. A good e - conference has a moderator who will edit and
discipline postings so that you receive only short and relevant
messages, and a very useful archive will be maintained which may be
searched easily by you;

<LI> freedom from location. For those of you who travel -- either locally
or internationally -- one of the greatest advantages of online
communication is your ability to leave files online and then dial in
and reach them from anywhere, anytime, using any computer. This is
easiest in France, where the Minitel plant enables you to reach at
least your own online text files from any of the millions of Minitels
which are scattered throughout the country. Increasingly this is true
elsewhere as well, however, as more and more users in all countries
sign up their local "computers" for Internet and Minitel use. As the
computer freed us from the paper file, so let the networks free us from
the computer: such is the dream, anyway, of anyone who has had to carry
a too - heavy laptop around the world.
