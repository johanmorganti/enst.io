<b>Data Sample</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Data samples are sets of rectangles used as input by the programs performing
spatial benchmarking operations.<p>
Tow types of data samples can be distinguished: Generated Data samples and Real
life Data samples.<p>
Generated Data samples are those created using the rectangle generator tool
implemented at ENST. The parameters that must be specified can be directly
obtained from the correspondent Data model. Several Data samples can be
generated after a single Data model.<p>
Real life Data samples are samples of rectangles borrowed from real life
applications, for example, from the Sequoia 2000 benchmark. There is no
previous Data model associated to these Data samples, and the distribution law
of x-coordinate, y-coordinate, angle and area of the rectangles is not
available (and can be difficult to determine), but the other ones can be easily
obtained. So, data model tables can be updated to include these values.<p>
