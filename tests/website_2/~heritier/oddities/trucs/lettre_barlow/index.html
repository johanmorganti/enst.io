Ok, for the benefit of the few that are still on this list I am posting
a post I got on 'another list' from a very special person.  It's not
that much fun, but I thought maybe someone would be interested.  What
ruins it for me is when he actually uses the word 'dissed'.

Oh boy,
jim

Re: the lack of quality control.  This has always been _the_ issue--that 
I'm somehow diluting the impact by releasing too much.  I've always 
thought that argument to be pretty reactionary and more suited to record 
execs and the like.  

I consider Belt Buckle, the Folk Implosion and the Lou Barlow & Friends 
record to be as catchy and worthwhile as anything I've done.  I can 
assure you just as much care went into writing and recording these 
projects.  The "Walk Through This World with ..." 7" is the only one 
I can really see as being a toss-off.  But, it was intended to be a 
cassette-only release but Drunken Fish wanted to release it etc.

The one thing I think that makes these things stand out is the humor, the 
groove...I had a lot of fun.

The thought of someone listening to "Puffing on a Pot Pipe" and "Run to 
You" and knitting their brows, feeling ripped off is so _sad_.  I can 
understand someone being kind of sick of my stuff...I have been around 
for awhile and you can't have that special feeling of discovery anymore.  
Dissing it as simply "boring" is unfair, especially if you like my other 
stuff.  You just sound like indie-rock curmudgeons.

It's so predictable.  And, for some reason, I wish you still liked my 
work. You seem like very smart young people with good taste.  It's too 
bad it has to end this way.

buh bye,

Lou B

I don't mean to seem snotty, but I'd seriously like to know what you're 
listening to and finding exciting, i.e., not boring.  E-mail Kath 
personally.  Thanks.  Most compelling and fascinating Top 10 lists will 
win the sender 10 free copies of the Drunken Fish single.  Post paid!
