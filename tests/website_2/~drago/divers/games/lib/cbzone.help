The following options are allowed:
      defaults are shown in <>'s

      [-b n]  specifies the number of blocks. <8>
      [-d n]  specifies the delay.  This number must be between
              0 and 10.  <5>
      [-l n]  specifies the number of landers. <4>
      [-m n]  specifies the number of missiles. <1>
      [-s n]  specifies the number of salvos that the player
              has available.  Default is max(ntanks, nmissiles).
      [-t n]  specifies the number of tanks. <2>
      [-O]    Set defaults to the original arcade version.
              This setting overides all options other than
              [-q] [-d n].
      [-S]    prints the current score file.
      [-V]    prints the current version.
      [-c]    copters and landers only. <FALSE>
      [-h]    prints this message.
      [-q]    quiet mode.  No beeps. <LOUD>

  Keyboard commands:
  'p' - pause
  'c' - continue
  'i' - pause and iconify (also spacebar)
        However, window managers are free to ignore this.
  'q' - quit (also ^C)
  'r' - redraw (also repositions to (0,0) and resizes
                to fill the display)

General Information
-------------------
  Cbzone is a version of Battlezone derived from the Fortran
sources written by Justin S. Revenaugh.  This version is more
flexible in that the number of opponents is user selectable.

  Input to the the game is primarily through the mouse, although
some keyboard commands are accepted.  Mouse left button will
fire a salvo; mouse right button will switch between low/high
gear.  On a three button mouse, the middle button will center
the joystick and stop your tank.  This facility can be done on
a two button mouse by hitting both buttons at the same time.
Directional control of the tank is by moving the mouse to
different portions of the screen.  The joystick in the
lower right hand of the screen will correspond to your
tanks current movement and rotation.

  Because of the interface between mouse position and game
input, the program will attempt to create a window that covers
the entire screen.  Since some window manager's will attempt
to title and border any windows as well as let the user place
them, the program will adjust the window position after the
user places it anywhere on the screen.  However, the first
few graphic objects may not be drawn, in this case keyboard
command 'r' (redraw) should resolve the problem.

  Scores are only eligible for the high score list if they
are played with the default options with the exceptions that
the delay can be 0-5 and quiet mode can be on.

Bugs
----
  Tanks currently move through one another, consider it a
feature.  Anything else is probably really a bug and should
be reported.
  Startup can sometimes be a problem with incorrect screen
placement, 'r' should also fix most of these problems.  If
not, send me mail w/ details about your environment.
