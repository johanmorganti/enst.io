<BIG>I'm over a month old now (less than two weeks on the pictures). I'm so big you
wouldn't believe it. I guess I could show you but for some reason my mum still
doesn't feel like going to the University to scan some pictures. I must say I
eat about 7 times a day and since she feeds me, she doesn't have much time for
doing anything else. My dad went back to work to hear that he looked tired for
someone who just had a vacation. You see, I'm so cute I manage to stay up late
at night so my mum and dad can admire me -wide awake- all night long. 
Jeremy is the most wonderful brother. He keeps on kissing me and hugging me. I
think he is really proud of me. I look just like him when he was born and it
sounds like I have about as much energy. What a team !</BIG>
