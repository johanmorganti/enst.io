 This thesis focuses on the support of applications that must meet
 temporal Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Today, the daunting
 task of transalting these temporal QoS constraints into
 scheduling diretives rests entirely on the
 programmer's shoulders.
 
 We propose an approach in which temporal QoS constraints are
 automatically translated into scheduling directives. We suggest that
 the software engineer programs his application by specifying temporal
 QoS constraints (expressed in the form of simple QoS equations) on the
 important events of his application. These temporal QoS constraints
 are automatically translated into scheduling directives. The
 application threads are partitioned into finer grain or elementary
 threads to which QoS constraints are applied. The elementary-thread
 decomposition is used to guide the scheduling of the associated
 user-threads. The scheduling framework involves a best-effort
 cooperative scheduling based on the Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
 policy.
 
 Since our scheduling framework involves a best-effort scheduling
 policy, no guarantees can be given. Applications must adapt their
 temporal constraints to load variation situations by enforcing
 graceful degradation or up-gradation according to specifications of
 softer or harder constraints provided by the designer. In this
 approach, monitoring is also available to provide enough feedback to
 tune the applications and their temporal QoS specifications.
 
 A resource sharing protocol is also proposed. It allows user-threads
 to share resources without deadlocks.
 
 Performance measurements concerning the additional cost of the
 automatic scheduling are done using a demonstrator that we have
 developed. These measurements seem encouraging. They are, however,
 very influenced by the number of elementary threads in the application
 and mostly by the dependencies that may exist between them.
