<P>

<B>Brett</B> - Look at her.
<BR>
<B>J.</B> - <I>Look</I> at her.
<BR>
<B>Saskia</B> - I thought she was <I>dead</I>.
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - Have you read her reviews?
<BR>
<B>J</B> - She's been dead for <I>years</I>.
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - Look at that <I>outfit</I>.
<BR>
<B>J</B> - The <I>way</I> that she <I>walks</I>...
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - It's her all over...
<BR>
<B>J</B> - And coming out the side.
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - <I>God</I>, she's so embarrassing.
<BR>
<B>J</B> - Embarrassing, <I>please</I>!
<BR>
<B>Saskia</B> - There are so many ways she can embarrass herself it must be difficult to choose just one.
<BR>
<B>J</B> - The hips, the boots, the hair...
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - And that <I>outfit</I>.
<BR>
<B>Saskia</B> - She's like a tube of lipstick sweating gin.
<BR>
<B>Brett</B> - She's not a writer, she's an "event".
<BR>
<B>J</B> - Perhaps her critics haven't seen her best work yet.
<BR>
<B>Saskia</B> - There's nothing she has her critics haven't seen.
