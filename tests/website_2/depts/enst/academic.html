<H1>Academic Opportunities</H1>
<hr>

To be educated at ENST is first a matter of acquiring
basic knowledge in the sciences and techniques that make up the
foundation of information and communications: telecommunications,
electronics, computing, networks, signals, and images.

<p>
It is also discovering the engineering profession and acquiring
competency in economics and management as well as in communication
and expression. Languages also constitute an essential part of
the degree program. Students will not only have lectures but also
practicals, projects, cases studies, visits of industries, internships.
Strong emphasis is lead on team work.

<H2>Flexible Programs</H2>
Students choose their Majors, Options, and Optional Modules,
and thus organize their course work according to their tastes and
their professional projects, while at the same time they acquire
a balanced and coherent general background.

<H2>The Diversity of the Student Body</H2>
The students come from very diverse background and may be integrated
into the degree program of ENST in First, Second, or Third
Year. This is one of the factors accounting for the richness and
uniqueness of the School.
ENST is particularly anxious to encourage applications
from foreign students.

<p>
<strong>In the first year,</strong> students from the European
Community who have completed at least two years of a scientific
higher education course (in particular in maths, physics,
electrical and electronic engineering, computer science,
telecommunications) and who are fluent in French are encouraged
to apply. Application forms are obtained from the
"Bureau Commun d'Admission" and should be returned before the
end of June. Admission is granted after a close examination
of the dossier, language tests and an interview with a panel
of examiners.

<p>
<strong>In the second year,</strong> students having completed
four years of higher education may apply through a selective
admission process.

<p>
<strong>In the third year,</strong> in the case of exchanges or
dual degree programs, foreign students may be admitted directly
into this year of specialization.

<H2>Short-term Student Exchanges</H2>
ENST offers students research or internship periods
of varying length (2-12 months) this, either in one of TELECOM
departments or in an associated industry. The nature of the
specific project given will depend on the academic level of
the student.

<p>
A small number of "auditeur libre" are admitted to ENST
each year. Students complete an academic year of study
but are not eligible for a ENST degree.
