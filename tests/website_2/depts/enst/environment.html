<H1>A Privileged Environment For Studies</H1>
<hr>

<H2>Close Relations between Students and Teaching/Research Staff</H2>
The core of research activities are conducted by about a hundred
permanent researchers, including 35 professors. In addition, there
are about 20 outside researchers from the Centre National
de Recherche Scientifique and elsewhere.
High-level group research guarantees the excellence of the courses
by ensuring their continual evolution. The physical presence
of the teaching and research staff in School makes them
particularly accessible to students. Professionals from industry
(about 650) also participate in instruction, either as visiting
faculty or as tutors for on-site internships in business settings.


<H2>The Facilities</H2>
Materially, the School is especially well-equipped, in particular
with a powerful computing network that supports two major
environments: one of them is UNIX, with Sun and HP workstations,
among others; the other VAX.

<p>
In addition to workstations, the School is equipped with a large
number of PC's and MacIntoshes. These are linked by Ethernet,
giving them access to worldwide networks.
Each department also has its own equipment that is continually
updated: microwaves and optoelectronic laboratories, echo
chambers and sound-proof rooms, professional recording studios,
equipment for high definition video, etc.

<p>
The vast majority of this equipment is available for student
use on a self-service basis.

<H2>The Library</H2>
The School's library contains a collection of about 15,000 books
and 650 journals. It is open Monday through Friday throughout
the year. National and International electronic databases
are available for teachers and students, who also have access
to eight other libraries in the Dobitel network.
