<H1>The School and Industry</H1>
<hr>

ENST is a gateway to the business world.
Because of the school's close relationships with companies,
students can prepare themselves for their future profession.
The Department of Economics and Management provides the first contact
with the corporate landscape. Instruction in economics not only
touches upon the internal functioning of companies and their
competitive and institutional environments. It includes cases
studies, the strategic positioning of companies, and hands-on
interviews in business settings.

<H2>Internships: a Major Stage in Learning about Industry</H2>
Between the first and second years, a worker-level internship
of at least a month allows the future engineer to get an inside
perspective on the production process and the daily reality of
people who work in a company.

<p>
At the start of the third year, the engineering internship, carried out
in conjunction with the second year Majors, allows the student to
put into practice some of the knowledge gained at the School
and especially to place him or her in the situation that will be found
by a practicing engineer.
At least two months of these internships must be done abroad.

<H2>The Alumni Relations Office</H2>
The Alumni association is a place of exchanges. Every 3 months,
a "Télécom" magazine is published and the Association organizes
meetings between students, alumni and business leaders.
The association is responsible for the Alumni directory and helps
students as well as experienced engineers to plan their careers.

<H2>Continuing Education</H2>
The programs for continuing education of ENST make it
possible for engineers to advance in their careers and extend their
areas of competence. Ninety different programs, built for designers
and users of complex computing, electronic, and telecommunications
systems, receive close to 2500 participants each year.
Tailor made sessions are also organized for interested companies.
A fast growing, the Continuing Education Department has made
the School into one of the most important centers for the
continuing training of engineers and managers in its areas of
specialization. An annual catalogue of training sessions is
published by the Continuing Education Department.

<H2>The Junior Enterprise: TELECOM Etudes</H2>
A genuine service company, TELECOM Etudes provides businesses
with expertise at very competitive prices in a number of the
disciplines taught at ENST.

<H2>Formacom: an Association for Training in Telecommunications</H2>
Students offer custom-designed courses for companies wishing
to develop their expertise in the areas of information
technologies and communications. Unique in its category, this
association allows students to consolidate their knowledge
while earning experience both in instruction and in business.
