<H1> Hello, I'm James Benenson</H1>
<p>Welcome to my home page! I'm one of the English teachers in the
 <A HREF="lgv/index.html/">Language Department at the ENST </A> here in Paris (and also at<A href="http://www.supelec.fr">  SUPELEC </A>  which is out in the country about 20kms south of Paris) <br>Besides teaching English I'm also a sculptor.</p> 

<p>This is one of my sculptures. It's called "La Grande Femme" and is a small bronze.</p>

<P> <strong>If you're in Paris and you'd like to see more there are always a few of my pieces at the:<br> Galerie Sculptures, 11 rue Visconti, Paris 75006 near metro St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s <br>

<P>
When I'm not sculpting I'm teaching English to engineering students.  Please go to the <a href="http://www.enst.fr/~benenson/lgv/index.html"> modern language department at the ENST</a> to learn more about the language department that I spend most of my time in.
</p>

<P> Since 1991 I've been involved with many different projects using the Internet to help my students improve their English. Last year (1994-1995) two of them were the Hut Writing Project  and the Cities Project. The Internet opens up a lot of possibilities to the language classroom. Some of the courses I've been teaching in the last years have been about exploring the <a href="http://www.enst.fr/~benenson/internet.html"> internet</a>. At the ENST some of my students are making a web page for our <a href="http://www.rezel.enst.fr:8080/~netproj1/">Internet Projects Class</a>. Have a look and tell us what you think.   
</p>
<P> This academic year my students are again participating in an <A href="http://www.hut.fi/~rvilmi/Project/IWE/newsgroup.html"> International Writing Exchange </A> organized by <A href="http://www.hut.fi/~rvilmi"> Ruth Vilmi</A> at HUT (the Helsinki University of Technology).   (Ruth has lots of interesting things to visit on her page.) This spring different classes are participating in the IWE in France, Finland, Korea, Egypt, Spain, Mexico and the US.
</p>


<P>
Another project that's very important to me is the <A href="http://www.enst.fr/tandem/"> International Email Tandem and Forum Project</A> organized by Helmut Brammerts at the Ruhr-Universitat in Bochum Germany. 
<br>I'm one of the coordinators of the<blink> <A HREF="engfra/index.html">ENG-FRA</A></blink> Discussion Group.
<br><strong>If you're a French speaker and  you'd like to have an English, Irish, American or Australian student to write to via email go to the <A HREF="engfra/index.html">ENG-FRA Page</A> to ask for a TANDEM partner.(And of course do the same thing if you're an English speaker and you'd like a French speaking partner!) :-)</strong>
