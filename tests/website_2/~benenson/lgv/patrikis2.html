</CENTER><BR>
Ladies and gentlemen. I am honored to have been invited to speak with you today on the subject of the transformations of the Internet in university education. The world
wide reputation of the Ecole Nationale Sup&eacute;rieure de T&eacute;l&eacute;communications, its distinguished faculty, its ambitious forward-looking students, and its evolving mission give me pause. From the outset I shall confess to you that I come as a stranger into your midst: I am not a scientist or an engineer of any sort; I no longer work in the lecture hall or the classroom; and I have been trained as a humanist, a student of European languages and literatures. Still worse, I belong to that lowly caste known as academic administrators. With your indulgence then, I would like to speak about the changes in higher education that are taking place, right before our eyes. In deference to your own concerns at T&eacute;l&eacute;com, I have chosen to focus on issues related to telecommunications, and I shall focus on developments in the United States, not so much because the States are the center of activity, but because the activity there is what I know best.<P> 
Perhaps in two or three centuries when historians are reflecting upon this millennial moment in which we now live, they will identify the creation and explosive development of the Internet as one of the major social, educational, technological and economic phenomena of this period. From the popular press to regular features in newspapers and business magazines, the news is the Net and the Web. About a month ago <I>Time Magazine</I> devoted its lead article to the new multimillionaires of the Web industry, and there on the cover was the pudgy and unprepossessing twenty-seven-year old Marc Andreessen, Netscape vice president of technology, the winner of InfoWorld's 1995 Industry Achievement Award, a young man whose net asset value in 1995 went from nothing to hundreds of millions of dollars. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> keeps us informed on a daily basis of developments in news articles, in special features called "Technology and You," and in regular supplements on investing, on education, and on the transformation of the work place; the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> has also seen an increase in advertising revenues, because there are now publicity pages announcing new World Wide Web pages.<P>
The technology of the Net and the Web also has significant political ramifications. Electronic information has no easy borders. In Iran, e-mail is being used to discuss political and religious topics that, if carried on in public, would lead to censure, prison, or worse. The democratic movement in the People's Republic of China depends on fax machines and the ubiquitous cellular telephone; the Chinese government is eager to enter the world of the Internet but only on the conditions of mounting strict "firewalls," as protective barriers are called, for what can pass in and out of the country. The dreaded topics are political reform, pornography, and international financial news -- surely one of the stranger groupings of topics. And even religion has taken to the Web: there are sites for Jainists, sites for Islam across the world, sites for ultra-orthodox Lubavitcher Jews, sites on new age cults, sites on heresies, and many others as well. One site of Japanese Buddhists declares "The Internet is a wonderful place to propagate Buddha's teaching." And Jacques Gaillot, the renegade Bishop of Parthenia who was banished by the Pope to a non-existent congregation in the midst of the Sahara Desert, has established his own rebellious Web site -- the first virtual chapel, a digital <I>vox clamans in deserto! </I> To draw upon the sociology of Emile Durkheim, we can say that the Internet is a construct fashioned by society or any particular group to meet its own social and political needs.<P> 
The only constants that we seem to be able to identify are change, continual change, rapid change, and surprising change. The predictive powers of regular business have been thwarted and challenged. No one expected AT&T to offer low-cost connections to the Internet; the next day stock prices for on-line services Compuserve and AmericaOnLine and for many related businesses dropped dramatically; since that time, all the other telephone carrier services in the United States have had to revise their plans and create instant alternatives to the AT&T offering. When IBM purchased Lotus Development Corporation in order to secure for itself the thriving business of Lotus Notes, Big Blue was not aware that the Net was spreading over that territory and that Lotus Notes would have to reinvent itself very quickly in order to survive. Even Bill Gates of Microsoft, the Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great of the computer world, was unprepared for the development of the Web and in one year has had to perform major transformations in his vast empire. Microsoft threatened its competition with the phrase, "The sleeping giant has awakened." The giant awakened very quickly indeed: in just the past month, Microsoft has introduced its own Web browser as an integral part of Windows 95 and has announced its own software to compete with Lotus Notes. If there is one educational lesson to be learned in all this confusion and transformation, it is this: We must learn to expect the unexpected, and we must learn to question, to rethink, to re-examine what it means to use the Net, to teach and to learn on it and with it.<P>
It might be useful to review briefly the history of the role of the computer in education. What we see is not a linear progression, not an inexorable progress from the simple to the complex. Instead, the history of the computer in education is a palimpsest: a parchment manuscript that has been written on more than once, with the earlier writing incompletely erased and often legible, so that we see through chronological and intellectual layers. There are two threads to the history, two threads that, until recently, were strictly separated: teaching on the one hand, and research on the other.<P> 
In the beginning was the digital machine, and the digital machine was good for distinguishing 0 and 1, yes and no, this or that. Earlier trials in computer-based education (like Plato on the mainframe computer at the University of Illinois) were restricted to multiple choice: this answer was right, anything else was wrong. One student sat in front of one machine in a large laboratory. Responses from the teacher were limited to artificial phrases like "Try again!" or "That's correct." The machine was a teacher, a tutor, or a tester, and it held the promise of revolutionizing teaching. One computer scientist with an obvious background in the Greek classics wrote the following limerick:<P>
<blockquote>The word has come down from the Dean<BR> That by means of the computing machine<BR> Young Oedipus Rex<BR>
Could have learned about Sex<BR>
Without ever touching the Queen.<BR>
<BR>
Very loosely translated as:<P>
Le Doyen fit savoir sans g&ecirc;ne<BR>
Que l'ordinateur enl&egrave;ve toute peine:<BR> Oedipe Rex<BR>
Aurait connu le Sexe<BR>
Sans jamais toucher la Reine.<BR>
</blockquote><BR>
As we went from the mainframe to the microcomputer, little changed until the advent of multimedia. With the ability to access text, sound, and image that came with the ever increasing power and storage capacities of the computer, new possibilities arose: experiments in chemistry and physics in a virtual laboratory, visual modeling in mathematics, simulation in history, text processing in literature&#138;<P>
Meanwhile, research in the sciences fueled the development of ever more powerful machines, and it promoted the national and international connections between machines. In a striking exemplification of the Biblical injunction to beat swords into plowshares, a military network intended for secret and secure communication (the Arpanet begun by the U.S. Department of Defense) has become the most public and publicized forum in the history of civilization -- the Internet. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee of CERN created the World Wide Web to facilitate communication among high energy physicists; little did Mr. Berners-Lee suspect that his local enterprise would spread like wild fire to millions of users throughout the world.<P> 
When these two aspects, research and teaching, came together, computer-based teaching at the university level made a major step forward into a new realm. That new realm is the Information Highway. I would like to depart from a narrow construction of my topic -- the Internet in university education -- to examine that term, its development by governments on both sides of the Atlantic, and its exploitation by the telecommunications industry. I wish to do so because the discourse about the Net and the Information Highway richly suggests the possibilities that our elected officials in our governments and our unelected officials in industry and commerce have foreseen for us. More important, the way in which government and industry present the potentialities of the Net betray profound cultural assumptions about technology, progress, and the nature of information processing in the free world of the West. In short, I invite you to follow along in a cultural <I>explication de texte</I>.<P> 
Many of us in the academic world have been driving along the highway for quite some time, exchanging research results, publishing papers quickly, communicating rapidly and inexpensively by electronic mail. (In the States we commonly refer to regular surface mail as snail-mail.) And many of us were content to drive the equivalent of a <I>Citro&euml;n 2 Chevaux</I>. The history of the Internet was altered in the summer of 1993, when Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, announced the plans for the building of an Information Superhighway. Gore's announcement of the National Information Infrastructure initiative was the first public governmental statement of its kind: it sought a concerted unified national effort within the boundaries of late-twentieth-century capitalism, and it provided clear official recognition of the explosive development of the digital frontier. A short extract from Gore's initiative, which I have taken off the Net, will suffice to demonstrate the perspective of the Clinton Administration:

<P> <BLOCKQUOTE>Access to communications networks is changing the way we provide for our families, educate our children, receive medical care, and interact with each other. It is transforming the way American businesses and entrepreneurs manage their companies and compete worldwide. It is empowering us in a variety of ways:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Entrepreneurs are starting small businesses providing services made possible by the new information technologies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Employees are telecommuting from their homes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Businesses are using computers and information technology to increase productivity and profits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Students in rural areas are taking courses offered by professors at universities hundreds of miles away via interactive video conferencing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Doctors are treating patients in counties far away from their hospitals by using telemedicine.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Citizens are sending electronic messages to government officials and are receiving government documents electronically.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>* Disabled Americans are using networks to communicate with others, both on the job and at home.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The remainder of the document clarifies what is involved. The telecommunications industry accounts for one tenth of the U.S. economy. More then 500,000 jobs are to be created in the next few years, and over the nextdecade more than $100 billion dollars is expected to be added to the Gross National Product of the United States. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the current market for Internet access and services world-wide is estimated at some 1 and 1/2 billion francs ($300 million) a year, and it will sky rocket to more than 50 billion francs ($10 billion) by the end of the decade. There is much talk about increased access to the government, increased representation, knowledge
based education, and reduction of health costs, but it is clear -- first and foremost -- that the Information Highway is THE next Big Business of the post-industrial global economy.<P>
Gore's announcement was a glove tossed in challenge to the rest of the world, and the European Union lost little time in responding. December of 1993 saw the publication of the Delors White Paper <I>Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment.</I> (Livre blanc Croissance, Comp&eacute;tivit&eacute;, Emploi). The white paper, which, curiously, I have not been able to locate on the Net, recommended the building of a transparent network in the European Union; it also represented a transparent reaction to and against the American challenge. The following year saw the publication of the Bangemann Report, <I>Europe and the Global Information Society</I>, Recommendations to the European Council: An Action Plan. (<A HREF="http://www.ispo.cec.be/infosoc/backg/bangeman.html">http://www.ispo.cec.be/infosoc/backg/bangeman.html</A>)<P> <BLOCKQUOTE>This Report outlines our vision of the information society and the benefits it will deliver to our citizens and to economic operators. It points to areas in which action is needed now so we can start out on the market-led passage to the new age, as well as to the agents which can drive us there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As requested in the Council's mandate, we advocate an Action Plan based on specific initiatives involving partnerships linking public and private sectors. Their objective is to stimulate markets so that they can rapidly attain critical mass. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this sector, private investment will be the driving force. Monopolistic, anti-competitive environments are the real roadblocks to such involvement. The situation here is completely different from that of other infrastructural investments where public funds are still crucial, such as transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This sector is in rapid evolution. The market will drive, it will decide winners and losers. Given the power and pervasiveness of the technology, this market is global.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The market will drive ... the prime task of government is to safeguard competitive forces....</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The prime task of government is to safeguard competitive forces and ensure a strong and lasting political welcome for the information society, so that demand-pull can finance growth, here as elsewhere.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE>By sharing our vision, and appreciating its urgency, Europe's decision-makers can make the prospects for our renewed economic and social development infinitely brighter.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
The Bangemann Report was followed immediately by "Europe's Way to the Information Society. An Action Plan." Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions (Brussels, 19 July 1994) (<A HREF="http://www.ispo.cec.be/infosoc/backg/action.html">http://www.ispo.cec.be/infosoc/backg/action.html</A>) These reports should be required reading for everyone at T&eacute;l&eacute;com because of their clear exposition of the issues and because of the way in which they establish the ground rules, as it were, for the discussion of the future of telecommunications:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The information society is on its way. A "digital revolution" is triggering structural changes comparable to last century's industrial revolution with the corresponding high economic stakes. The process cannot be stopped and will lead eventually to a knowledge-based economy.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&#138; the report emphasizes the urgency of adopting its recommendations. The race is on at global level, notably US and Japan. Those countries which will adapt themselves most readily will de facto set technological standards for those who follow. It also underlines the global nature of the issue, and calls for proper coordination mechanisms, and the advancement of international negotiations.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
The subsequent report "Europe's Way to the Information Society" treated diverse issues that have become standard concerns throughout the literature:<P> <CENTER>Towards a Competitive Environment<BR> Standardization, Interconnection and Interoperability<BR> Tariffs<BR>
Worldwide Dimension<BR>
Intellectual Property Rights<BR>
Privacy<BR>
Electronic Protection, Legal Protection and Security<BR> Media Ownership<BR>
Competition<BR>
Audiovisual<BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>	Let it suffice to say that these reports, subsequent reports, and
the many reactions to these reports from governmental entities, universities, and the private sector form the current legal and political foundation of the potentialities of the Internet in higher education. The reports also suggest -- but they do not resolve in any obvious manner -- the extreme tension that appears to exist between Europe, the United States, and Japan, to name only the major players in the global information society. I say "tension that <I>appears</I> to exist" between these nations, because the documentation is confusing. On the one hand, the Delors White Paper, the Commission Report under the direction of Martin Bangemann, the report on "Europe's Way to the Information Society," and an additional report out of the European Parliament entitled <A HREF="http://www.ispo.cec.be/cgi-bin/vdkw_cgi/xad51f4ef 219/Search/2828780/2#HL0">"European Information Highways: Which Standards?"</A> (1995) -- all place Europe in a struggle against the other major world computing powers. (We should notice, however, the conspicuous absence of China, Russia, and even major economic forces like India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Taiwan.) Yet at exactly the same time that the Bangemann report and its immediate successor appear, an information policy conference at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, involving European and American leaders in government and education at MIT announces "a major international initiative to develop a universal computer framework for the global information society" (<Q HREF="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/lcs/consortium.html">http://www.lcs.mit.edu/lcs/consortium.html</A>). <P> <BLOCKQUOTE>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) will cooperate in the further development and standardization of the World Wide Web to make the world computer network easier to use for research, commercial use, and future applications, it was announced at a news conference at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is of the utmost importance that these computer frameworks be worldwide frameworks," said Dr. Martin Bangemann, the Commissioner of the European Union in charge of industrial policy, information technologies and industries, and telecommunications. "The European Union intends to support this cooperative activity as an important step toward the Global Information Society," he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Clearly, while governmental organizations speak of competition, education institutions promote solidarity and cooperation.	And while governmental organizations speak of competition, major corporations forge ahead, redefine the concept of competition, and create new global alliances. Take, for example, the business partnership of Deutsche Telekom, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, et Sprint, known as<A HREF="http://www.global-one.net/"> GlobalOne</A>.<P> 
It comes, then, as no surprise that important political, economic, and cultural assumptions underlie all these reports and that the Information Highway itself reflects those assumptions. The very phrase "the Information Highway" is American to the core: it speaks of the freedom of the road, the independence brought by the automobile, the crossing of great distances with great ease and at great speed. The term is nostalgic. But the metaphor of the Information Highway is too good to abandon, and it domesticates for the lay public the extraordinary complexity behind the phenomenon. Just get into your car and drive!<P>
As I prepared my remarks for today, I took the opportunity to cruise the Net in order to see how different telecommunications companies portrayed themselves. An earlier version of the home page of Telecom Italia took literally the metaphor of the information highway -- l'autostrada dell'informazione -- and constructed its identity in accordance with the image of Italian red racing cars like the Ferrari. The <A HREF="http://www.wirehub.nl/TriMM/ptt_tel/homepage.htm"> Dutch PTT Telecom</A>, by contrast, presents us with imagery that suggests not technology but possibly agriculture: green, undoubtedly symbolizing ecology and the natural environment, is the principal color. And the home page evokes a filing card or a calling card, rather than a computer or other advanced technological device.<P> 
I believe that it is important to keep in mind that there are social and cultural assumptions underlying what we encounter on the Internet and not to pretend that the Information Highway is one vast neutral space, a virtual terra incognita, available to students and teachers alike. The Internet remains overwhelming in its ever increasing size, daunting in its rapid speed of development, and perplexing in the opportunities offered to all of us in higher education. The Internet is a paradox: at one and the same time an undiscovered New World and a crowded landscape littered with fellow explorers.<P> 
A recent survey of colleges and universities in the United States indicated significant increases (+/- 50% in the past three years) in the use of e-mail, multimedia resources, computer simulations, and commercial courseware for educational purposes, and a majority of institutions have made the Internet and the World Wide Web a priority for the next three years. Literally every day universities are expanding the kinds of resources that are available both to those within the university (faculty, students, and staff) and to those outside the university (prospective students, alumni, and visitors). Here is the example of Princeton University, which is one of the members of my organization. 
The university home page, as you can see, combines several different functions: with its handsome picture of the central campus, the home page is at one and the same time a news bulletin, a map, a telephone and e-mail directory, a course catalogue, a public relations documents, and a link to the outside world. It is common to refer to the university environment as The Ivory Tower, the pure and lofty site where scholars isolate and protect themselves from the every day world. I have never found the metaphor apt, but the Web assures that the Tower is open for all to visit and see.<P>
The college and university home pages that now proliferate in the United States reflect the increasingly common ownership of personal computers (the estimate ranges as high as 33% for homes in the U.S.) and the even more common use of computers by faculty, students, and staff on our campuses. Not to be on the Internet is now considered almost as bad as not having a library. Not having an institutional home page is the sign of the backward and of the underprivileged.<P>
The Internet is beginning to assume many different kinds of functions in university education. Before I show you examples of those functions, I would like to outline quickly a taxonomy of what those functions are or what they will be:<P>
(1) The Internet can serve as the Lecture Hall, where faculty present current work to students and colleagues. We shall see several examples of the migration of lectures to the Web.<P>
(2) The Internet can serve as the Course Director or Course Manager. Increasingly teachers are developing Web pages for the syllabus, bibliography, schedule, and assignments of their courses. That page provides a description of the course, of the faculty, and of the assistants in the course. I know of some instances where hard copy of this routine information is no longer available, unless the students prints the information directly off the Net. Just last month a friend and colleague who worked at a traditional university press accepted the new position of Director of Electronic Publications, where she will oversee the migration of university documents from hard copy to the Web. In the near future, if a students wishes to consult the course catalogue -- that publication is now some 500 pages long -- he will do so on the Web or he will pay to have a copy printed.<P>
(3) The Internet can serve as the Classroom. The Electronic Classroom is a new feature on many American campuses, and it assumes diverse configurations. There are some classrooms where the teacher arrives, plugs a laptop computer into the network and projection system, and then proceeds to lead a class with multimedia demonstrations. There are some electronic classrooms where each student is seated before a computer and does work assigned by the teacher there in the class; the teacher can then project anyone's work (identified or anonymous) onto a screen at the front of the room for everyone to discuss. And I know of an Electronic Classroom where students share Macintosh PowerBooks, all of which have infrared connections to the local area network, the campus network, and the Internet.<P>
<BR>
(4) The Internet can serve as the Laboratory. Computer simulations of experiments in, let us say, physics will move from videodisc to multimedia servers. We shall see some examples in a few moments.<P> (5) As we have all come to see, the Internet can serve as a Library, a repository of publications, bibliographies, and electronic resources like applications, Java applets, spread sheets, search engines. That library will also be a non-commercial Publishing House.<P> 
(6) The Internet can serve as the Post Office. Electronic mail (and even electronic voice mail), list servers, and the rapidly developing Intranet offer new ways of promoting effective communication among faculty, among students, and among students and faculty. The collaborative ideal of the business community, which has been a routine model in the academic scientific community and which is increasingly becoming a model and ideal for those in the human sciences, finds new possibilities on the Net. We shall see a variety of home pages that serve this function.<BR>
<BR>
(7) Finally, I would like to propose that the Internet will serve as an Object of Study. For all students and scholars of communication and expression, whatever their discipline, the Internet is revolutionizing those very terms. Indeed, especially for students and faculty at T&eacute;l&eacute;com, the Net can, and probably should, become a special focus for all courses.<P> 
Let us turn now to some specific examples of how your colleagues in the United States are using the Web for educational purposes. I have searched many different pages and have chosen sites that illustrate a wide variety of possibilities and that provide examples of the basic taxonomy that I have presented to you.<P>
I would like to begin with a page at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, since MIT is a sister institution to T&eacute;l&eacute;com in many respects. This page -- <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/acs/www/acaduses2.html">http://web.mit.edu/acs/www/acaduses2.html </A> -- is devoted entirely to the different academic uses of the World Wide Web in a variety of disciplines. Reading from top to bottom, let us identify the interesting features: Academic Computing Services; e-mail for corrections and additions; encouragement to the non-Web-literate faculty; a variety of departments ranging from architecture, the humanities, the social sciences, and, understandably, a full range of the pure and applied sciences. 

<P> Example 1: Advanced Topics in Design and Computation<BR> (<A HREF="http://alberti.mit.edu/arch/4.207/homepage.html">http://alberti.mit.edu/arch/4.207/homepage.html</A>)<BR> The course description. Assignments and announcements. The schedule. Lecture notes (September 28th). Students papers (political economy) and final projects.<P>

(http://www.tc.cornell.edu:80/Visualization/Education/cs418/index.html)<BR> We see many features similar to those in the previous MIT Web pages, and I would point out to you the link for Language Lab Chat, on-line discussion of the laboratory assignments. This page goes one step further by incorporating illustrative animations. <P>
Mathematical Animation Gallery.<BR>
http://mathserv.math.sfu.ca/Animations/animations.html<P> How did I happen to find these examples? By surfing the Net, by using several of the powerful search engines that are available on the Web, and by finding the new centralized efforts to take control of information.<P> (1) UC/Irvine: Frank Potter's Science Gems: links across the spectrum of education from the lowest grades of elementary school to university instruction.<BR>

http://www.syllabus.com/toptwenty.html<P> Pages such as these confront us with two kinds of problems: (1) determining how we are to deal with so much information and (2) determining how these resources affect our daily work in practice and in theory.<P> The pages that I have shown you are deep in hypertextual reference and rich in links across the globe. They fundamentally alter our notion of bibliography: perhaps we should coin the neologism "Webography." Are we back at the Tower of Babel? There are thousands upon thousands of home pages, thousands upon thousands of links in those home pages. We face redundancy and reduplication of effort, but for the time being it is the price we shall have to pay to have access to so much information. We are currently limited by the admittedly powerful but simple search systems now available on the Web (Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Alta Vista, and the like). All of these searches are now of the Boolean type: Boolean searches allow us to ask for "this and this and not that," so they cannot be sophisticated. And these searches depend on the less than systematic self
description of existing Web pages. Almost any search seems to lead to irrelevant, trivial, and even comic references.<P> What are we to do with so much information? How do we cope with it? How do we keep abreast of information? How do we keep afloat? Or do we drown? The explosion of knowledge pushes us to pose new questions. What is information? What is organization and order? Shall we re-create the discipline of library science? Shall we have a Renaissance of the nineteenth-century German scholarly ideals of exhaustive reference works? One computer magazine <I>MacUser</I> included with its latest issue a road map for the Information Highway: it is in the size and format of a standard U.S. road map, but it offers a graphical introduction to Web resources. Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development, has suggested that it will be necessary to create some kind of knowledge
structure system, akin to the Dewey Decimal System that is used in America's public libraries, and the Encyclopedia Britannica is pushing its Propaedia (Outline of Knowledge) as the basis for searches in its new CD-ROM version.<P> The organization of the flood of data, I believe, is much less of a problem than our understanding of how teaching and learning will be affected. If you recall the taxonomy of functions of the Internet that I proposed a few moments ago, you will certainly have noticed some glaring omissions, omissions that are intentional on my part. I do not accept as useful or viable the principal assumptions about the use of computers in education some twenty or thirty years ago: in short, I do not see the computer primarily as a Teacher, a Tutor, or a Tester. Allow me to repeat some observations that I made yesterday in my presentation to the Department of Foreign Languages. I propose an evolution of the use of the computer away from the computer as "agent" to the use of the computer as an "instrument." Instead of serving as the Teacher, the computer will serve as a Resource. This evolution from the agentive function to the instrumental function rejects narrow notions of education as the mere transfer of knowledge from one person to the next and recognizes all the new possibilities of multimedia computing . (Perhaps, some day, when we have fully realized artificial intelligence, we shall have computers that serve as intelligent teachers, as well as rich instruments of teaching and research.) Some twenty or thirty years ago, the predictions placed one student in front of one machine in one central facility, whereas now we have different possibilities: an entire class before a machine, groups of two or three students at the same machine, computers in the classroom, in the lecture hall, in the laboratory, in the library, at the computer cluster, in the private office, at home in one's study or bedroom, and eventually wherever one can connect to a network.<P>
The computer and the Internet represent more than just new means and sources of information, because access to information changes our traditional assumptions about teaching and learning, and information alters the traditional hierarchies of our educational institutions. Students will have more or different information from what their teachers and their fellow students have, thus altering the balance of intellectual power and expectation in the classroom. In many instances, we have already seen a shift in the role of faculty, away from mere instructor (the person imparting information) to what many colleagues call the "designer of tasks." The role of the student also shifts away from mastery of information to proficiency in using information: finding information, organizing information, analyzing information, interpreting information, re-organizing information, and re-presenting information. The information revolution forces us to pose new questions: What is training? What is education?<P>
In the general enthusiasm over the Internet, fueled by computer magazines and reviews and by the barrage of advertisements for Internet access, there are a few Jeremiahs, prophetic voices crying out against the developments I have been discussing. These voices are not those of Luddites, technophobes, or mere reactionaries; and they are not the voices of the conservative right wing, fearful of free exchange of information and ideas and eternal guardians of what is known as "family values" (that is, those who fear pornography and easy access to sexually related materials). These voices are, instead, those of concerned observers. A recent announcement of a lecture series included these three titles, in this leading order: (1) "The Promise of Information at the Turn of the Millennium," a title that possibly suggests religious transformation; (2) "The Transition to the Information Age: Opportunities and Challenges to Higher Education," a title that suggests advantages and disadvantages; and finally (3) "The Information Highway: The Road to Nowhere," a title that denies any positive thoughts in the first two lectures. That last talk is by one Clifford Stoll, who wrote a book entitled <I>Silicon Snake Oil</I>. Recently, one university president asked whether the ease of e-mail communication resulted in lower standards of communication, not simply careless writing, but discourteous and abusive language. In 1992 the cultural critic Neil Postman published a work entitled <I>Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology</I>, in which he attempts to defend humanistic values against the encroachment of computers. (It is not a very good book, because the arguments are often glib or simplistic, but it does raise many issues worth pondering.) <P> In the October 1995 issue of the prestigious journal <I>Science, </I>Eli M. Noam, professor of Finance and Economics and Director of the Institute for Tele-Information at Columbia University, the man who coined the term "Information Highway," published an article entitled "Electronics and the Dim Future of the University." I would like to summarize for you Professor Noam's arguments. His major premise is that<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&#138; while new communications technologies are likely to strengthen research, they will also weaken the traditional major institutions of learning, the universities. Instead of prospering with the new tools, many of the traditional functions of universities will be superseded, their financial base eroded, their technology replaced, and their role in intellectual inquiry reduced. This is not a cheerful scenario for higher education.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
Noam defines three functions for the university: the creation of knowledge, the storage of knowledge, and the transmission of knowledge &#139; in other words, scholarship, libraries, and teaching. Scholars and students gather around that repository of information. But now there is so much information, he fears that universities will collapse under the weight or be fragmented into small, unrelated parts. Noam gives the example of the publication <I>Chemical Abstracts</I>. It took thirty-one years to publish the first million abstracts, and eighteen years to publish the second million abstracts. Now it takes less than two years to publish another million abstracts. With the exponential explosion of information comes specialization; with specialization comes sub-specialization; and with sub-specialization comes hyper-specialization. No single institution is capable of covering all aspects of a field, so scholars in sub-specialties have no immediate colleagues in that particular field and are isolated in their own institution. Their colleagues are elsewhere, distant or virtual colleagues connected on the conference circuit or on the Internet. With virtual colleagues Noam sees an erosion of institutional cohesion, a loss of loyalty to one's home institution, the shift of one's personal identity away from a professor at this or that institution to a member of a subdiscipline. Noam admits, and we all recognize, that the shifting of allegiances is not new to higher education; technology exacerbates the problems.<P> The cost of library acquisitions is rising so quickly and so steeply that collections are in danger. Professor Noam offers, once again, the example of <I>Chemical Abstracts</I>, for which the annual subscription rate has gone from $12 in 1940, to $3,700 in 1977, to a staggering $17,400 in 1995. A colleague and friend, who serves as the humanities bibliographer in religion and European history at one of the major university libraries in the United States, has expressed the fear that collection building &#139; that is the librarian's term for buying books and journals &#139; is diminishing as the new managers focus time, effort, and money on providing electronic access to new and other resources.<P>
Noam also foresees a deterioration of the role of faculty as the curriculum &#139; lectures and materials &#139; moves to the network, especially if commercial distributors, publishing companies, seek to establish sophisticated electronic courses taught by the most prestigious members of the field. In other words, this expert in telecommunications sees the possibility of virtual departments taking over credentials, specialization, socialization, and apprenticeship, effectively undermining the very basis for the existence of a university.<P>
It has become clear to you that I did not choose to interpret the topic given to me &#139; the Internet and Education &#139; in a narrow or merely practical manner. I hope that I have shown you some exciting examples of the new possibilities of the new technology, but I have also attempted to frame those demonstrations in a wider social, educational, political, and economic context. And it is with that context, broadly conceived, that I would like to conclude my presentation.<P>
Earlier, when I proposed a taxonomy for the functions of the Internet in education, I suggested that the Internet itself would become an Object of Study. 
Education on and about the Internet will move beyond issues of transfer protocols, issues of the speed of transmitting sound and moving image, and issues of the fee structure for the use of Java applets to the consideration of the wider social and economic consequences of speeding along the Information Highway. We shall need to consider not only what the Internet can do <I>for</I> us, but also what the Internet does <I>to</I> us. Universities are conservative institutions, but they are not immune, as recent history has made all too clear, from social and political and economic events.<P> You in the European Union face the privatization and liberalization of telecommunications monopolies. You face keen competition where, heretofore, there has been little or no competition (competition for markets, for goods, for access rights, for services). And you face the pressures of catching up in the building and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Information Highway: bringing it to customers and convincing customers to ride the Information Highway. Apart from the sheer economics of the enterprise &#139; because far fewer schools, universities, and homes in Europe own computer equipment, let alone connections to the Internet &#139; a shift in cultural expectations will have to be made. A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal of the 100 largest European corporations indicated that fewer than 13% of the Chief Executive Officers knew how to use e-mail! (This is not an exclusively European problem. Another survey, this one conducted by Lotus Development, has indicated that 90% of the managers in U.S. corporations believe that technology is <I>critical</I> for success in the global economy but that fewer than 20% of those managers know how to use networks, the World Wide Web, and on-line services.)
<P> A transparent transnational Information Highway demands the full cooperation of all the members of the European Union. Given the technological demands of that infrastructure, the highway will not allow the kinds of political compromise that have been commonplace in agricultural treaties or educational exchanges. No single country will be able to assert "We wish to do it this way," while others agree to do it another way. Transparency and speed will not tolerate compromise. Indeed, it is even possible that governments will be bypassed entirely by various organizations: by multinational corporations (like AT&T), by newly organized corporations (like British Telecommunications if it acquires Cable and Wireless for over 90 billion francs), by giant partnerships (like that of France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, Deutsche Telekom, and Sprint), by major consortia like Ebone (a major pan-European Backbone connecting over forty regional networks in more than twenty countries to the Global Internet for commercial and research users), or by commercial entities that do not yet exist.<P>
The handsome booklet that describes the programs and activities of France T&eacute;l&eacute;com concludes with an up-beat section entitled "A Place to Work&#138; and Live&#138; and a Good Place to Start From." That title resonates with the optimism that has traditionally characterized new employment, but I wonder if that optimism is a thing of the past. We in the United States are only just now beginning to understand aspects of computer efficiency: along with technology upsizing comes corporate downsizing, promoted by increased deregulation, consolidation, and competition. In the past five years, more than one and a half million mid-level managers have lost their jobs. With ready access to data and data analysis on the network, mid-level positions that collect and analyze data have become superfluous. Mid-level managers have become "irrelevant" and discarded like obsolescent IBM XT's or Apple II's. Networked information creates exciting new possibilities with profoundly disturbing implications. We can envision corporate departments being replaced by virtual work teams; just think, in the new corporations of the Europe Union one member of a team might be here in Paris, another in Berlin, and a third in Rotterdam. Departments and teams get shuffled and changed from project to project, from current need to the next perceived need. The distinction of manager and worker becomes less clear, and the corporate pyramid is flattened. Last week Time Magazine published its first supplement, entitled Time Digital, devoted to the topic "How to Survive Digital Downsizing." I ask you to consider the social implications. The notion of long-term employment becomes a thing of the past. Loyalty to one's employer will also become a thing of the past. Insecurity, anxiety, and unemployment will follow. There will be profound social changes that we do not and that we cannot yet understand&#138;<P> I have intentionally juxtaposed the dire predictions about the fate of the university and the dire state of corporate change. The two paths seem to be moving in tandem and in a parallel manner. But shall I end on this pessimistic note? No, not at all! It is clear that social, industrial, economic, and educational ills are thrown into sharper focus by the revolution of the Information Highway. It is also clear, however, that our position in the eye of the storm gives us the opportunity be part of change and to reflect upon that change at the same time. And we are able to reflect. First, we have the time. While the pace of technological change approaches dizzying speed, economic reality &#139; in other words, our inability to pay for what technology has made possible &#139; dramatically slows the pace of change. Second, we may be misreading employment trends. With the breakup of AT&T in 1984 and with recent reorganizations, some 250,000 jobs have been lost. But 400,000 new jobs were created in the overlapping telecommunications industries in the United States alone &#139; in just the past year! Third, we probably lack the experience to understand the kind of economic change that is taking place. Literally, each day, day after day, in the newspapers and business press we read of new billion-dollar deals &#139; mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs, new companies &#139; staggering amounts of money are moving across the globe. Finally, the computer is not a crystal ball. It is only a machine, and a machine that cannot understand itself. All the changes I have documented in the telecommunications industry, in the remainder of the business world, and in education are changes wrought, not by machines, but by our fellow citizens and colleagues. Clearly, then, to study the role of the Internet in education is to study the Social Contract.
