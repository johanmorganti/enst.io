JWP version 1.31 - A Japanese Word Processor for Windows
--------------------------------------------------------
Copyright (C) Stephen Chung, 1995.  All Rights Reserved.


Hardware and Software Requirements
==================================

    JWP is designed to be run on IBM PC and compatible computers under
the Microsoft Windows operating environment, version 3.1 or higher. As a
result, a computer with an 80286 CPU or higher is required.  Although
you can run Windows with 2 MB of RAM in the computer, the minimum
recommended set-up is 4 MB for acceptable performance.

    JWP is very processing-intensive.  A faster computer will greatly
enhance the program's responsiveness.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you
use at least a 33 MHz 80486 computer.  Slower computers may give
annoying delays, especially when working with large paragraphs.



Installing and Running JWP
==========================

    To install JWP, follow the steps outlined below.  I realize that
this installation process is more manual than necessary; however, since
JWP is a freeware project, I do not have the option of bundling a
commercial installer.  Maybe someday I'll write one. . . Meanwhile,
sorry for the inconveniences. Those interested in installation and other 
support may also contact Hongbo Data Systems (see below).

Important:  JWP files come in 'Zip Archives'.  There are unarchive
            programs freely available on the Internet, both for DOS and
            for Windows. A popular DOS unarchiver is PKUNZIP.EXE; a
            popular Windows one is WINZIP.EXE.



Installation Steps
==================

Step 1: Create a new directory for JWP.

        For example, if you want to call the directory 'JWP' in the 'C:'
        drive, you should type (in DOS):

            C:  <Return>
            MD \JWP  <Return>

        or (in the Windows File Manager):

            Choose the 'File' menu
            Choose the 'Create Directory' command
            type C:\JWP  <Return>

Step 2: Switch to the JWP directory.

        Double-click the directory in the Windows File Manager or type
        the following in DOS:

            CD \JWP  <Return>

Step 3: Unpack all the `zip' files into the new sub-directory.

        For example (in DOS):

            PKUNZIP JWPPROG.ZIP  <Return>
            PKUNZIP JWPFONTS.ZIP <Return>
            PKUNZIP JWPDICT.ZIP  <Return>
                    :
                    :

        If you use a Windows unarchiver, read the instructions that come
        with the software.

        If you have obtained JWP on diskettes with the files already
        unpacked, copy all the files into the new sub- directory.  For
        example (in DOS):

            COPY A:*.* <Return>

        for each diskette.

Step 4: Make sure that you have all the files necessary for JWP.  A list
        of all the files can be found following these instructions as
        well as in the file `FILES.LST'.

        The DOS command "DIR/P" will display a list of all the files in
        the current directory.  Alternatively, look in the Windows File
        Manager.

Step 5: Copy the file CTL3DV2.DLL to your Windows System directory.  In
        many systems, the Windows System directory is something like
        `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM'.

        If you already have the file CTL3DV2.DLL in your Windows System
        directory, you should double-check the dates on the two files.
        Use the most recent one.

        To copy the file, you should drag the file into the Windows
        System directory (with File Manager) or copy it via a DOS
        command like::

            COPY  CTL3DV2.DLL  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM  <Return>

Step 6: ERASE the file CTL3DV2.DLL from your JWP directory.  Due to a
        command from Microsoft Oh-High, JWP may not work if a copy of
        CTL3DV2.DLL is left in the program directory.

        You can erase the file from within the Windows File Manager,
        or via a DOS command like:

            ERASE  CTL3DV2.DLL  <Return>

Step 7: JWP is ready to run. Unlike many commercial Windows programs,
        JWP does not automatically install itself into the Program
        Manager.  It is necessary for you to use the "File New" command
        and add a program item into the appropriate program group. You
        can now run JWP by double-clicking on the JWP icon.



IMPORTANT!!!
============

    The User's Manual, MANUAL.DOC, is NOT a Japanese file.  DO NOT
attempt to open it with JWP - it will most surely cause JWP to crash.
MANUAL.DOC is a "Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0" file and must be opened
with a word processor that reads W4W 2.0 files, such as Windows Write,
Lotus Ami Pro, WordPerfect, etc.



What Other Goodies Can I Get?
=============================

    The site ftp.cc.monash.edu.au contains a large archive of Japanese
software under the directory /pub/nihongo.  It is also the official
distribution site for new updates to all the databases and dictionaries
that JWP uses.

    JWPFONT is a font editor running under DOS that allows the user to
create and modify JWP kanji fonts.  Look also for a large collection of
kanji fonts to use under JWP.

    The Japanese-English dictionary (EDICT) and Kanji-Info database
(KINFO) is based on software released by Jim Breen.  A number of other
freeware packages draw on these libraries, among them JDIC/XJDIC/WinJDIC
(to access the dictionary) and JREADER (to read Japanese text files).
These packages can all be obtained from the Monash archive.

     Professor Jim Breen has a large collection of Japanese-English
dictionaries for different topics (e.g. legal).  Ask him nicely
(jwb@capek.rdt.monash.edu.au) and he may give you some.

     If you like JWP, then you should also try out Hongbo Data Systems'
NJStar.  There are NJStar versions for Chinese and Japanese word 
processing, and it is shareware.  The original version of NJStar runs 
under MS-DOS and is packed full of editing and printing features.  New 
versions of NJStar will have scalable fonts and run as native Windows 95 
applications.

     NJWIN, also from Hongbo Data Systems, is a shareware utility for
programs to display Japanese/Chinese characters in English Windows 95.
Try it. Hongbo Data Systems can also be contracted:

    The following files may come with your package.  They are not part
of the standard JWP distribution and are likely to be personal files
left over by the previous user from whom you received this package.  It
is up to you whether to keep them or not.

        USERDICT.DCT  User Kana-to-kanji conversion dictionary
        CNVCACHE.SAV  Kana-to-kanji conversion choices



Upgrading From JWP Version 1.3
==============================

o Version 1.31 is a maintenance update of JWP 1.3.  The new files you
  need are:

        JWP.EXE           JWP version 1.31
        JWP.HLP           New on-line help
        MANUAL.DOC        New User's Manual
        MANUAL.EXE        Self-viewing version of the User's Manual

o Version 1.31 fixes the problem of JWP exiting when *no* printers are
  installed in Windows.  Nevertheless, it is always a better idea to
  install a dummy printer (LaserJet III works best).

o Version 1.31 now supports multiple Japanese-English (or any other
  language) dictionaries.  Install new dictionaries via the "Options"
  button in the Dictionary window.

  In the JWP.INI initialization file, the original lines under the
  "[File Names]" section:

        [File Names]
        Japanese Dictionary=C:\JWP\EDICT
        Japanese Dictionary Index=C:\JWP\EDICT.JDX

  are now moved to a new "[Dictionary]" section:

        [Dictionary]
        Number of Dictionaries=1
        Dictionary #1=C:\JWP\EDICT|C:\JWP\EDICT.JDX|Yes|
                        EDICT : Jim Breen's Japanese-English Dictionary

  Each entry is divided into four parts, separated by "|":

        - First part        Dictionary path-name
        - Second part       Index path-name
        - Third part        Active? (Yes or No)
        - Last part         Description (in EUC format)

  You can add new dictionaries by adding new entries to this section.

o Version 1.31 also allows censorship of various types of entries (e.g.
  proper names, vulgar expressions, etc.) in the dictionary search.

  In the JWP.INI initialization file, lines are added under the
  new "[Dictionary]" section:

        Number of Keywords=31
        Key #1=pn|Yes|person names (family or given)
        Key #2=pl|Yes|place names
        Key #3=giv|Yes|given names
        Key #4=fem|Yes|female given names
        Key #5=male|Yes|male given names
        Key #6=vulg|Yes|vulgar expressions or words
        Key #7=X|Yes|rude or X-rated terms
        Key #8=col|No|colloquialism
        Key #9=m-sl|No|manga slangs
        Key #10=MA|Yes|martial arts terms
                   :
                   :

  Each line corresponds to one type of dictionary entry, divided into
  three parts separated by "|":

        - First part        Abbreviation code
        - Second part       Include in dictionary searches?  (Yes or No)
        - Third part        Detailed description (in EUC format)

  Whenever a dictionary entry contains any abbreviation code within
  parentheses, e.g. "(col,m-s)", JWP 1.31 will decide whether to show
  the entry or not, depending on your selection.
  


Upgrading From JWP Version 1.1
==============================

o The new files you need are:

        JWP.EXE           JWP version 1.31
        JWP.HLP           New on-line help

        KINFO.DAT         Jim Breen's KINFO file, version 2.4
        KINFOSTR.IDX      Jim Breen's KINFO index files
        KINFOBSH.IDX

        RADKANJI.DAT      Radical Lookup files
        RADKANJI.IDX
        STROKNJI.DAT
        STROKNJI.IDX

        MANUAL.DOC        New User's Manual
        MANUAL.EXE        Self-viewing version of the User's Manual
        MB.EXE            Mile Bones: A new recreational program
        COPYRGHT.TXT      A file containing copyright notices

o The Microsoft 3D controls library, CTL3D.DLL, is now changed to the
  newest version, CTL3DV2.DLL.  This file must be in the Windows System
  directory and should NOT remain in the JWP program directory.

o JWP 1.31 no longer requires the DOS program MAKEINI.EXE to create the
  initialization file JWP.INI.  The main program assumes the
  responsibility of creating a new JWP.INI initialization file or
  automatically updating your old settings.

o JWP 1.31 now uses the files from Jim Breen's KINFO files (including
  the index files) unchanged.  The KINFO.DAT and KINFO.IDX files from
  the original JWP distribution are no longer supported.  In the JWP.INI
  initialization file, the original line under the "[File Names]"
  section:

        Kanji Info Index=C:\JWP\KINFO.IDX

  now reads:

        Kanji Info Index (Stroke)=C:\JWP\KINFOSTR.IDX
        Kanji Info Index (Bushu)=C:\JWP\KINFOBSH.IDX

o Starting from version 1.2, JWP templates are placed in a separate
  templates directory, usually a "TEMLATE" subdirectory of the main JWP
  directory.  In the JWP.INI initialization file, the following is added
  to the "[File Names]" section:

        Templates=C:\JWP\TEMPLATE\

  which you can change.

o The new "Radical Lookup" method requires four files and a hotkey
  assignment.  They are all stored in the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [File Names]
        Radical Lookup Database (Bushu)=C:\JWP\RADKANJI.DAT
        Radical Lookup Database Index (Bushu)=C:\JWP\RADKANJI.IDX
        Radical Lookup Database (Stroke)=C:\JWP\STROKNJI.DAT
        Radical Lookup Database Index (Stroke)=C:\JWP\STROKNJI.IDX

        [Hot Keys]
        Radical Lookup=^L

  For power users, the default behavior of Radical Lookup may not be
  satisfactory.  JWP 1.31 allows you to further customize:

        1) When searches are performed -  either by pressing the Search
                                          button or automatically
                                          whenever the choices change

        2) How the kanji list is sorted - not sorted (quickest), sorted
                                          by stroke count (slower),
                                          sorted by stroke count with
                                          Level 1 kanji's always in
                                          front of Level 2 kanji's
                                          (slowest)

  If you decide to change the default settings, add or change the
  following lines in the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [Others]
        Automatic Radical Lookup=Yes        or No
        Radical Lookup Sort Method=1        0 = no sorting
                                            1 = stroke
                                            2 = level/stroke

o JWP 1.31 now distinguishes between Ctrl+letter and Shift+Ctrl+letter
  hot-key combinations.  For example, "^G" in the "[Hot Keys]" section
  in the JWP.INI initializaiton file now means Ctrl+G, different from
  "+^G" which now means Shift+Ctrl+G.

  Because of this, 23 more hot-key combinations are available
  (Shift+Ctrl+26 letters minus H, M and I).

o The new "Input Line Editor" has two special hot-keys requiring two
  lines in the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [Hot Keys]
        Toggle Input Line Editor=F5
        Toggle Active Input Window=^V

o It is now possible to map several more functions to hot-keys.  The following
  hot-keys are added to the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [Hot Keys]
        Cut Text=None
        Copy Text=None
        Paste Text=None
        Select All=None
        Insert Soft Return=None

o JWP 1.31 indicates "page breaks" within a file for better printing
  control. Pagenation is NOT automatic; the "Repagenate" command under
  the "Format" menu must be used to recalculate the page breaks.

  In addition, a "hard page break" may be set anywhere within a file by
  pressing Ctrl-Enter or an assigned hot-key.

  The following hot-keys are added to the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [Hot Keys]
        Insert Page Break=None
        Repagenate File=None

o Normall, JWP will repagenate only when it is told to do so (via the
  Repagenate command under the Format menu).

  If you have a fast computer (such as a rip-roaring Pentium... you make
  me jealous), and you are editing only small files, you can instruct
  JWP to AUTOMATICALLY repagenate whenever a change is made.  That way,
  the page breaks shown in the file will always be current.

  To specify automatic repagenation, you must change the following lines
  in the JWP.INI initialization file:

        [Others]
        Automatic Repagenation=Yes

o JWP 1.31 can now print files vertically.  Use the "Print Vertical"
  command under the "Format" menu to toggle between vertical and
  horizontal printing modes.  Pressing the two new buttons on the
  iconbar achieves the same results.  The default is horizontal.

  In vertical printing, all Japanese characters, including JASCII text,
  will be rotated 90 degrees COUNTER-CLOCKWISE.  JWP knows that some
  Japanese characters should not be rotated, and that some characters
  (such as the comma, period, etc.) should be placed in a new place
  instead of simply being rotated.

  Normal English ASCII text will not be rotated so the document, when
  read vertically, will have English text rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

o JWP 1.31 can now distinguish between normal ASCII (English text) input
  and JASCII (fixed-width ASCII characters in the JIS character set).
  Pressing the JASCII button in the iconbar will toggle between normal
  ASCII and JASCII modes.  JASCII characters are used to facilitate
  vertical printing (normal ASCII text will not be rotated, but JASCII
  characters will).  The following hot-key is also added to the JWP.INI
  initialization file:

        [Hot Keys]
        Toggle ASCII / JASCII mode=F3

o JWP 1.31 has a (very slightly) different file format.  It will read all
  version 1.1 files and templates transparantly, but will only save as
  version 1.31 format.

o JWP 1.31 supports Drag & Drop.  You can now drag and drop a file onto
  JWP's editing screen and have JWP automatically open the file for you.
  Why anyone would want to do that beats me but Microsoft keeps telling
  me that Drag & Drop is "intuitive".

o JWP 1.31 now automatically "registers" itself into Windows' Registry.
  All the standard file format extensions (such as .EUC and .SJS) are
  registered such that JWP 1.31 will be used to open these files when
  they are clicked upon.

o JWP normally defaults to showing only JWP Normal files in its "Open
  File" dialog box.  To change this default, change the following line
  in the JWP.INI initialization file, for example:

        [Others]
        Default Open Format=Auto-Detect

  Use format names identical to those in the "File Format" list-box in
  the "Open File" dialog box.

o Read JWP32.TXT for notes on the 32-bit version.
