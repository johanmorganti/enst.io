Partner's mistakes? </font></h2>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Every Tandem Partner
will be writing both in his/her mother tongue and in a second
language. When you write in the second language, mistakes quite
naturally occur. They are really nothing to worry about, but part
of the learning process. They occur ab ove all when you are
trying out something new and unfamiliar. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Normally, if you can
understand your partner despite his/her mistakes, you wouldn't
bother to correct him/her. Unfortunately, in language learning,
this can give rise to a rather serious problem: your partner
thinks that (s)he has expressed him/hersel f accurately and
therefore carries on making the same mistakes. We must find ways
to prevent this.... </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Why should we
correct?</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">At the start of your
partnership, discuss the problem of correction with your partner.
It is quite acceptable for him/her not to want to be corrected. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">What should we
correct?</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Sort out with your
partner which kinds of mistake (s)he wants you to correct without
fail. It is virtually impossible to correct everything. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">--For example, does
(s)he want you to concentrate particularly on what is odd,
impolite or inappropriate in his/her use of the second language? </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">--Does (s)he want you
to concentrate on errors of vocabulary and expression? </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">--Does (s)he want you
to concentrate on grammatical inaccuracies? Or is spelling the
most important thing for him/her? </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Discuss with each
other why these particular aspects of language are important to
you? Of course, you can use quite different criteria. (You can
choose what these should be; they should be the things which are
most important for your partner.) </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">How should we
correct?</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">You can correct in a
number of different ways: </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If you feel that you
have spotted an error that your partner doesn't usually make,
simply point out the existence of the mistake. You can confine
yourself, for example, to indicating where a mistake has taken
place. Or you can rectify the mistake, by typing the correct
version in a blank line, inserted below it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If it is a mistake
which distorts what your partner is trying to say, explain to
him/her how the meaning of the utterance has been altered. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">If it is a mistake
which makes the utterance seem inappropriate or rude, explain to
your partner why this is so. You can give examples of how a
native-speaker might react to the utterance as it stands. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Bear in mind that
corrections can sometimes be unpleasant for those being
corrected. Respond sensitively to any indication that (s)he has
taken offense. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Perhaps you have quite
different ideas about correcting mistakes. You can try anything
out as long as the two of you agree on how to go about it. </font></p>

<h4><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Please check with
your subnet coordinators or your language teacher if you have any
questions.</font></h4>
