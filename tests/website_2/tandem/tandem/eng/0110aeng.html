<h1> People around us</h1>
<p>Every day we meet and communicate with different kinds of people - be they family, friends , people we like and don't like or just casual acquaintances.</p>
<p>Think about the various people who cross your path  every day.<br>
Tell your partner about these people.<br>
Talk especially about those people who interest you most
<strong><ul>	
<li>	because you are either attracted or disgusted by them
<li>	because you don't really know them and you would like to know more about them.
<li>	because you think you know them well, even though you have very little contact with them
<li>	because they influence you more than they might know themselves
</ul></strong>
