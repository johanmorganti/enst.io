<h1>Telling a good tale</h1>
<p>Tales and legends form parts of the cultural wealth of a country. Who has not, on long winter nights with the light flickering and the wind howling in the trees, heard such stories. Who has not said to his/her mother just before going to sleep, ``Mummy, tell me a story"? And she had no sooner said ``Once upon a time there was ..." when we would close our eyes and hand ourselves over to the world of fairy stories and magic. A life without such magic would be all the poorer.</P>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>So, tell your partner one of the fairy stories from your country, one that you know well and which arouses in you unforgettable memories and emotions so that you can tell it with feeling and pleasure. Please, no Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood or Cinderella. And tell it so that your partner can repeat it easily at a later date. And don't forget the actions, an essential feature of story telling.</P>
