<P>You have been with your partners for some days now and you must certainly have become aware – in conversation with them and based on your own experience – of the many little differences between life in Britain and your country.
<H2>Task</H2>
<P>That is today's task: make a bilingual list of the "surprising little quirks" which add spice to daily life in their country and yours.
<P>Think about things which you like in your partner's country, which you miss, which you don't particularly like or which have surprised you. These things can be connected to times, meals, making friends, socialising, college, etc.
