<p>Our life is punctuated by holidays and celebrations of all kinds. Every country and every region has its own special days in addition to holidays which we may share in common.
<P>In Britain
<ul>
<li>we have, of course, Christmas and Easter as our main religious holidays;
<li>we have six Bank Holidays scattered throughout the year;
<li>we celebrate Guy Fawkes, father's day, mother's day, birthdays, weddings, and so on;
<li>and we take our main holidays in the summer.
<li>Some towns or regions have special celebrations. York, for example, has a three week Viking Festival.
<li>On Pancake Tuesday people race through the streets in some towns.</DIR>
