<P>We all know that the world is shrinking. Yet in our global village we don't always see things in the same way. Geographical, religious, economic and social differences and even personal taste are reflected in the pages of our daily paper. Our newspapers represent to some extent our collective response to conflicts, fears, hopes and joys.
<P>In this task you'll have the opportunity of looking at the same issue from different perspectives; that of your own press and that of your partner's.
<P><br>
<h3>Task</h3>
Having read both versions,
<ul>
<li>identify the differences between the English versions and those of your language (content, scope, point of view, style, conclusions ...);
<li>try to find out the reasons for these differences;
<li>discuss the issues with your partner from your respective points of view;
<li>summarize the points on which you are agreed – in both languages – so as to be able to report back to the group at a later date.
</ul>
