<h1>Proverbial chains</h1>
<h3>Task</h3>
<P>Form a bilingual chain of sayings and expressions.</P>
<P>Each saying or expression has to be followed by another in the other language. It must be linked to the previous one either in terms of meaning or vocabulary.</P>
<P>Here are some examples:</P>
<ul>
<li>...
<li>Al que madruga, Dios le ayuda.
<li><i>The early bird catches the worm.</i>
<li>M&aacute;s vale <I>p&aacute;jaro</I> en mano que ciento volando.
<li>Many <I>hands</I> make light work.
<li>...
</ul>
<p><br>
<P>Ingenious or amusing changes to the proverbs and expressions are particularly welcome, e.g.
<p>He is a legend in his own lunchtime (instead of <I>lifetime</I>)<BR>
He's a wheel short of tandem (instead of <I>He's a sandwich short of a picnic</I>)<BR>
and you don't have to be a Dorothy Parker or an Oskar Wilde to think up a few.</P>
<P>Naturally, you present the sayings and expressions in your own language -- the examples in your partner's version can serve as a stimulus. Explain to your partner (if possible in your own language) what the meaning is and in what circunstances they can be used. Bear in mind that you should be able to explain <I>in English</I> the meaning and use of all the sayings and expressions.</P>
<p><br><p><br>
<h3>Some examples</h3>
<P>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</P>
<P>More haste, less speed.</P>
<P>Too many cooks spoil the broth.</P>
<P>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</P>
<P>A stitch in time saves nine.</P>
<P>Necessity is the mother of invention.</P>
<P>He who laughs last, laughs longest.</P>
<P>Give a dog a bad name.</P>
<P>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</P>
<P>An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth.</P>
<P>It's an ill wind that does nobody any good.</P>
<p><br><p><br>
<P>to pull someone's leg - to talk tongue in cheek - to put your foot in it - to make a pig's ear of it - to weep buckets - to laugh like a drain - to have your heart in your mouth - to have your head in your hands - to have your head in the clouds - ...</P>
