<h1>Good Old South Yorkshire</h1>
<P>There is no doubt that we are living in a time of internationalism and of overcoming petty nationalism. And yet, all the same, your own home area always has its special appeal. So, we consider ourselves not only British but also belonging to a smaller area. We all like to talk about our home area and tell others about its people, customs, places, etc.</P>
<h3>Task</h3>
<P>Ask your partner to tell you about his/her home area and you will see how enthusiastically he/she will talk about</P>
<ul>

<li> its history,</li>
<li> its towns,</li>
<li> the solidarity of its inhabitants,</li>
<li> its dialect,</li>
<li> its customs and folklore,</li>
<li> its importance in Britain,</li>
<li> its present and future potential,</li>
<li> its political institutions</li>
<li> and who is in power,</li>
<li> its culture and cultural life, etc.</li>
</UL>
<P>However, if you are interested in other topics (economy, tourism, social matters ...), ask for the appropriate information. Take relevant notes so that you can describe all you have learnt in English at a later stage. If you compare notes and add the information you have obtained to that of your friends, you will get a very full picture of the area.</p>
