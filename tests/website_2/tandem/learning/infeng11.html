<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Arial, sans serif"><strong>What
is language learning in tandem? </strong></font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif"><strong>Learning in
tandem</strong> involves a form of open learning whereby people
with different native languages work together in pairs </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">in order to learn
        each others' language(s) </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">to learn more
        about their partner and their partner's culture </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">to exchange
        additional - e.g. professional - knowledge. </font></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="PRINZIPIEN"></a><font color="#FF0000" size="3"
face="Arial, sans serif"><strong>Tandem principles</strong></font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Tandem learning is <strong>learning
in partnerships </strong>and <strong>autonomous intercultural
learning</strong>. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">There are 2 important <strong>prinicples</strong>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Each partner has
        to benefit equally from working together, at least
        subjectively (<strong>Principle of Reciprocity</strong>).
        The same amount of time has to be spent on each language,
        both partners have to support each other equally, etc.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Each person is
        responsible for their own learning process and therefore
        establishes their own learning objectives and methods (<strong>Principle
        of Learner Autonomy</strong>). Objectives and methods are
        rarely the same for both partners. <br>
        Each partner is available as an expert in their language
        and culture: they can read out loud, if desired,
        elaborate on a topic picked by the partner, correct
        mistakes, make suggestions for improvement, etc. However,
        they are usually not trained to teach: neither learning
        objectives, methods and evaluation can be expected of
        them, nor the systematic preparation of learning material
        (grammar, etc.).<br>
        Tandem learning requires and promotes the ability to
        learn a language autonomously.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Language learning in
tandem is <strong>easily adapted to a wide variety of language
learning contexts</strong>: tandems between students with
different native languages at a university, between exchange
students and native students at a school, between
English-speaking tourists in Spain and Spanish learners of
English, between German teachers of French and French teachers of
German &#150; these are just a few examples. In <strong>tandem
courses</strong> (usually intensive courses), the tandem work is
combined with other course components.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Previous <strong>experience</strong>
with tandem learning </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">in bi-cultural
        tandem intensive courses,</font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">between learners
        with different native languages at the same university</font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">via the Internet
        with partners in different countries</font></li>
</ul>

positive (see the </font><a href="tanbib.html" target="info"><font

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans serif">Tandem partners
generally sit across from each other and communicate orally (<strong>face-to-face
tandem</strong>). Starting in 1992, however, the </font><a

(in particular written tandem learning using e-mail and other <em>Internet</em>
resources like MOOs) and to facilitate the development of new
didactic aids for learners, foreign language teachers and network
co-ordinators. </font></p>

        increasingly taking place through individual counselling.
