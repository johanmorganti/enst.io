<H2> Should I correct my Tandem Partner's mistakes? </H2>


<P>	Every Tandem Partner will be writing both in his/her mother tongue and in a second language. When you write in the second language, mistakes quite naturally occur. They are really nothing to worry about, but part of the learning process. They occur above all when you are trying out something new and unfamiliar. 
<P>	Normally, if you can understand your partner despite his/her mistakes, you wouldn't bother to correct him/her. Unfortunately, in language learning, this can give rise to a rather serious problem: your partner thinks that (s)he has expressed him/herself accurately and therefore carries on making the same mistakes. We must find ways to prevent this....
<P><H3>Why should we correct?</H3>
	<P>At the start of your partnership, discuss the problem of correction with your partner. It is quite acceptable for him/her not to want to be corrected.

<P><H3>What should we correct?</H3>
	<P>Sort out with your partner which kinds of mistake (s)he wants you to correct without fail. It is virtually impossible to correct everything.

<P>--For example, does (s)he want you to concentrate particularly on what is odd, impolite or inappropriate in his/her use of the second language? 
<P>--Does (s)he want you to concentrate on errors of vocabulary and expression? 
<P>--Does (s)he want you to concentrate on grammatical inaccuracies? Or is spelling the most important thing for him/her? 
<P>Discuss with each other why these particular aspects of language are important to you? Of course, you can use quite different criteria. (You can choose what these should be; they should be the things which are most important for your partner.) 

<P><H3>How should we correct?</H3>
<P>You can correct in a number of different ways: 
	<P>If you feel that you have spotted an error that your partner doesn't usually make, simply point out the existence of the mistake. You can confine yourself, for example, to indicating where a mistake has taken place. Or you can rectify the mistake, by typing the correct version in a blank line, inserted below it.
	<P>If it is a mistake which distorts what your partner is trying to say, explain to him/her how the meaning of the utterance has been altered. 
	<P>If it is a mistake which makes the utterance seem inappropriate or rude, explain to your partner why this is so. You can give examples of how a native-speaker might react to the utterance as it stands. 
<P>	Bear in mind that corrections can sometimes be unpleasant for those being corrected. Respond sensitively to any indication that (s)he has taken offense.
<P>	Perhaps you have quite different ideas about correcting mistakes. You can try anything out as long as the two of you agree on how to go about it.
