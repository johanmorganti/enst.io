<H1>HTML Primer</H1>

<P>
This is a primer for producing documents in HTML, the markup language
used by the World Wide Web. 

<H2><A NAME = "A1.3">Creating HTML Documents</A></H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <I>You can preview a document in progress with NCSA Mosaic (and
    some </I><I>other Web browsers). Open it with the </I><B>Open Local
    </B><I>command under the </I><B>File</B><I> menu. </I>
    
    <P>
    <I>After you edit the source HTML file, save the changes. Return
    to NCSA </I><I>Mosaic and </I><B>Reload</B><I> the document. The
    changes are reflected in the on-</I><I>screen display.</I>

<H3><A NAME = "A1.3.1">The Minimal HTML Document</A></H3>
<P>
Here is a bare-bones example of HTML: 

<PRE>
    &lt;TITLE&gt;The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
    &lt;H1&gt;This is a level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    Welcome to the world of HTML. 
    This is one paragraph.&lt;P&gt;
    And this is a second.&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<A HREF="MinimalHTML.html">Click here</A> to see the formatted version
of the example.

<P>
HTML uses markup tags to tell the Web browser how to display the text.
The above example uses:

<UL>
<LI>the <SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP> tag (and corresponding <SAMP>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</SAMP>
    tag), which specifies the title of the document
<LI>the <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> header tag (and corresponding <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>)
<LI>the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph-separator tag
</UL>

<P>
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>), (a ``less
than'' symbol to mathematicians), followed by name of the tag and closed
by a right angular bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>). Tags are usually paired,
e.g. <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>. The ending
tag looks just like the starting tag except a slash (/) precedes the
text within the brackets. In the example, <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> tells
the Web browser to start formatting a level-one heading; <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>
tells the browser that the heading is complete. 

<P>
The primary exception to the pairing rule is the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>
tag. There is no such thing as <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP>.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG><I> HTML is not case sensitive. </I><SAMP>&lt;title&gt;</SAMP><I>
is equivalent to </I><SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP><I> or </I><SAMP>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</SAMP><I>.
</I>

<P>
Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser
does not support a tag, it just ignores it. 

<H3><A NAME = "A1.3.2">Basic Markup Tags</A></H3>
<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.2.1">Title</A></H4>
<P>
Every HTML document should have a title. A title is generally displayed
separately from the document and is used primarily for document identification
in other contexts (e.g., a WAIS search). Choose about half a dozen
words that describe the document's purpose. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <I>In the X Window System and Microsoft Windows versions of NCSA
    </I><I>Mosaic, the </I><B>Document Title</B><I> field is at the
    top of the screen just below the </I><I>pulldown menus. In NCSA
    Mosaic for Macintosh, text tagged as </I><SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP>
    <I>appears as the window title.</I>
    
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.2.2">Headings</A></H4>
<P>
HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being
the most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder
fonts than normal body text. The first heading in each document should
be tagged <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>. The syntax of the heading tag is:

<P>
<SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP><VAR>Text of heading</VAR><SAMP>
&lt;/H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP> &gt;</SAMP>

<P>
where <VAR>y</VAR> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level
of the heading. 

<P>
For example, the coding for the ``Headings'' section heading above
is 

<PRE>
    &lt;H3&gt;Headings&lt;/H3&gt;
</PRE>

<H5><A NAME = "A1.3.2.2.1">Title versus first heading</A></H5>
<P>
In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title. For
multipart documents, the text of the first heading should be suitable
for a reader who is already browsing related information (e.g., a chapter
title), while the title tag should identify the document in a wider
context (e.g., include both the book title and the chapter title, although
this can sometimes become overly long). 

<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.2.3">Paragraphs</A></H4>
<P>
Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML
files aren't significant. Word wrapping can occur at any point in your
source file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space.
(There are couple of exceptions; space following a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>
or <SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP> tag, for example,
is ignored.) Notice that in the bare-bones example, the first paragraph
is coded as 

<PRE>
    Welcome to HTML.
    This is the first paragraph. &lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
In the source file, there is a line break between the sentences. A
Web browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only
when it reaches a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tag. 

<P>
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG> You must separate paragraphs with <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>.
The browser ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text.
HTML relies almost entirely on the tags for formatting instructions,
and without the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags, the document becomes one
large paragraph. (The exception is text tagged as ``preformatted,''
which is explained below.) For instance, the following would produce
identical output as the first bare-bones HTML example: 

<PRE>
    &lt;TITLE&gt;The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;H1&gt;This is a level 
    one heading&lt;/H1&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. This is one 
    paragraph.&lt;P&gt;And this is a second.&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
However, to preserve readability in HTML files, headings should be
on separate lines, and paragraphs should be separated by blank lines
(in addition to the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <I>NCSA Mosaic handles &lt;P&gt; by ending the current paragraph
    and insert</I><I>ing a blank line. </I>
    
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In HTML+, a successor to HTML currently in development, <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>
becomes a ``container'' of text, just as the text of a level-one heading
is ``contained'' within<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt; ... </SAMP><SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>:

<PRE>
    &lt;P&gt;
    This is a paragraph in HTML+.
    &lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The difference is that the <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> closing tag can
always be omitted. (That is, if a browser sees a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>,
it knows that there must be an implied <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> to end
the previous paragraph.) In other words, in HTML+, <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>
is a beginning-of-paragraph marker.

<P>
The advantage of this change is that you will be able to specify formatting
options for a paragraph. For example, in HTML+, you will be able to
center a paragraph by coding

<PRE>
    <SAMP>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</SAMP>
    This is a centered paragraph. This is HTML+, so you can't do it yet.
</PRE>

<P>
This change won't effect any documents you write now, and they will
continue to look just the same with HTML+ browsers.

<H3><A NAME = "A1.3.3">Linking to Other Documents</A></H3>
<P>
The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link regions of text
(and also images) to another document. The browser highlights these
regions (usually with color and/or underlines) to indicate that they
are hypertext links (often shortened to <DFN>hyperlinks</DFN> or simply
<DFN>links</DFN>).

<P>
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <SAMP>&lt;A&gt;</SAMP>, which
stands for <DFN>anchor</DFN>. To include an anchor in your document:

<OL>
<LI>Start the anchor with <SAMP>&lt;A</SAMP> . (There's a space after
    the <CODE>A</CODE>.)
<LI>Specify the document that's being pointed to by entering the parameter
    <SAMP>HREF=&quot;</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>&quot;</SAMP>
    followed by a closing right angle bracket: <SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>
<LI>Enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current
    document.
<LI>Enter the ending anchor tag: <SAMP>&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP>.
</OL>

<P>
Here is an sample hypertext reference: 

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;MaineStats.html&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This entry makes the word ``Maine'' the hyperlink to the document <SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>,
which is in the same directory as the first document. You can link
to documents in other directories by specifying the <DFN>relative path</DFN>
from the current document to the linked document. For example, a link
to a file <SAMP>NJStats.html</SAMP> located in the subdirectory <SAMP>AtlanticStates</SAMP>
would be:

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;AtlanticStates/NJStats.html&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
These are called <VAR>relative links</VAR>. You can also use the absolute
pathname of the file if you wish. Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax.

<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.3.1">Relative Links Versus Absolute Pathnames</A></H4>
<P>
In general, you should use relative links, because

<OL>
<LI>You have less to type.
<LI>It's easier to move a group of documents to another location, because
    the relative path names will still be valid.
</OL>

<P>
However, use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are
not directly related. For example, consider a group of documents that
comprise a user manual. Links within this group should be relative
links. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference to related software)
should use full path names. This way, if you move the user manual to
a different directory, none of the links would have to be updated.

<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.3.2">Uniform Resource Locator</A></H4>
<P>
The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify
the location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type of
resource being accessed (e.g., gopher, WAIS), the address of the server,
and the location of the file. The syntax is:

<P>
<VAR>scheme</VAR><SAMP>://</SAMP><VAR>host.domain</VAR><SAMP>[:</SAMP><VAR>port</VAR><SAMP>]/</SAMP><VAR>path</VAR><SAMP>/</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR>

<P>
where <VAR>scheme</VAR> is one of

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>file</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT>
<DD>a file on your local system, or a file on an anonymous FTP server
    
<DT><SAMP>http</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a World Wide Web server 
<DT><SAMP>gopher</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a Gopher server 
<DT><SAMP>WAIS</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a WAIS server 
<DT><SAMP>news</SAMP>
<DD>an Usenet newsgroup
<DT><SAMP>telnet</SAMP>
<DD>a connection to a Telnet-based service
</DL>

<P>
The <VAR>port</VAR> number can generally be omitted. (That means unless
someone tells you otherwise, leave it out.)

<P>
For example, to include a link to this primer in your document, you
would use

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF = &quot;http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html&quot;&gt; 
    NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This would make the text ``NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML'' a hyperlink
to this document.


<H4><A NAME = "A1.3.3.3">Links to Specific Sections in Other Documents</A></H4>
<P>
Anchors can also be used to move to a particular section in a document.
Suppose you wish to set a link from document A and a specific section
in document B. (Call this file <SAMP>documentB.html</SAMP>.) First
you need to set up a <DFN>named anchor</DFN> in document B. For example,
to set up an anchor named ``Jabberwocky'' to document B, enter 

<PRE>
    Here's &lt;A NAME = &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Now when you create the link in document A, include not only the filename,
but also the named anchor, separated by a hash mark (#).

<PRE>
    This is my &lt;A HREF
